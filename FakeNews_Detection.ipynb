Paul Anka is celebrating 60 years as an entertainer and songwriter this year, which makes him the only artist in history to have a song in the Billboard Top 100 during seven consecutive decades. Paul has shown himself to be the consummate, professional showman and entertainer. On Wednesday night he moved the audience from teary nostalgia to utter joy and hand clapping.\n",
      "Backed by a 10 piece band consisting of a horn section with trumpet, Trombone and saxophone, percussion and bongo set, drums, three guitars, violin, keyboards and grand piano, it was truly a Vegas-style band and one of the best I’ve heard.\n",
      "Paul opened up with Tom Jones’ song “She’s A Lady” followed by a jazzy version of “Mack the Knife.” Paul then did a very nostalgic look with an onscreen scrapbook of his life from the beginning of his career when he was 16 and meeting all kinds of celebrities from Ed Sullivan to Johnny Carson and Jackie Gleason to pictures of his five daughters and ending with his current now 12-year-old son. Paul showed these while singing “The Time of Your Life” which made it quite poignant.\n",
      "When Paul did his hit song “Having My baby” his female violinist sang the woman’s part with a lovely melodious voice. Paul updated it a bit first singing “having my baby,” then singing “having your baby” then “having our baby.” Maybe this was because at the time when it came out feminists complained of the chauvinist nature of it.\n",
      "Paul then went into a medley of his hits singing “Put Your Head on My Shoulder” going into the audience and picking out a young girl who was celebrating her sweet sixteen birthday and dancing with her, then moved into “They Called it Puppy Love” and “Lonely Boy.”\n",
      "Paul recalled when he was approached by film producer Darryl Zanuck who wanted him to do a song for his picture about D Day called “The Longest Day.” Paul then did that song. He also appeared in the movie which was an all-star cast featuring John Wayne and others.\n",
      "Paul showed his diversity by doing a brand new slow romantic song on the grand piano he just recorded with Michael Buble then segued into a really sensual version of Prince’s “Purple Rain” that featured a very haunting sax solo. He then switched to doing an acoustic guitar set of foot stomping, rousing country songs with the three guitarists that featured a really fantastic, lively violin solo that got a huge applause from everyone.\n",
      "Finally, Paul started telling about meeting Frank Sinatra for the first time and everyone knew what was coming. Paul told how he was at the Copacabana one night when a very dapper dressed man came up to him and said: “The boys in the back room want to see you.” He said he got a little choked up when hearing “The boys” want to see you. He went and was introduced to Frank Sinatra. He said Frank wanted him to write a song for him and he said “I could change the words from Puppy Love to be “Love is a bitch” to which Sinatra replied ’Keep writing kid.”\n",
      "A few years later he contacted Frank and asked him if he still wanted him to write a song for him and Frank said he was retiring now. It was then that Paul wrote “My Way” for Frank. He then performed it and the responded with a rousing applause and then became silent. Paul ended the concert with his hit song “Diana” getting the audience to sing along in the chorus.\n",
      "It was a two-hour non-stop concert that was one of the best I’ve been to and well worth seeing. Paul is 76 years old now and still has all the charm, style and grace he always had and sounds terrific. If you get the chance be sure to catch Paul Anka when he comes to a town near you. You won’t be disappointed.\n",
      "Hear Paul Do “My Way” from August of this year out in San Jose, Calif. This is exactly the band he had tonite when I saw him.\n",

      "You can’t make this up. The IRS awarded Equifax with a multi-million dollar fraud prevention no-bid contract despite that its own execs committed market fraud when they sold shares before telling the public they were hacked.\n",
      "The IRS will pay Equifax $7.25 million to help verify taxpayer identities and prevent fraud under a no-bid contract issued last week.\n",
      "The credit agency will “verify taxpayer identity” and “assist in ongoing identity verification and validations” at the IRS, according to the award.\n",
      "The award describes the contract as a “sole source order,” which means Equifax is the only company held capable of providing the service. The order was issued to prevent a lapse in identity checks while officials resolve a dispute over a separate contract.\n",
      "Both Republican and Democrat lawmakers bashed the IRS decision as irresponsible and horrible.\n",
      "“In the wake of one of the most massive data breaches in a decade, it’s irresponsible for the IRS to turn over millions in taxpayer dollars to a company that has yet to offer a succinct answer on how at least 145 million Americans had personally identifiable information exposed,” Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told POLITICO in a statement.\n",
      "“The Finance Committee will be looking into why Equifax was the only company to apply for and be rewarded with this. I will continue to take every measure possible to prevent taxpayer data from being compromised as this arrangement moves forward,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said.\n",
      "Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) also expressed their distaste for the deal writing letters to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen demanding he explains why the agency awarded the contract to Equifax as well as provide information on any alternatives they may have considered.\n",
      "“I was initially under the impression that my staff was sharing a copy of the Onion, until I realized this story was, in fact, true,” Blumenauer wrote.\n",
      "The IRS defended its decision in a statement, stating that Equifax told the agency that none of its data was involved in the breach and that Equifax already provides similar services to the IRS under a previous contract.\n",
      "“Following an internal review and an on-site visit with Equifax, the IRS believes the service Equifax provided does not pose a risk to IRS data or systems,” the statement reads. “At this time, we have seen no indications of tax fraud related to the Equifax breach, but we will continue to closely monitor the situation.”\n",
      "Early last month Equifax was hacked exposing the personal information of as many as potentially 150 million Americans, which included social security numbers, birth dates, and other private information.\n",
      "Afterwards three executives sold off $1.8 million dollars of the companies stock before telling the public. The Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into those three Equifax executives.\n",
      "Another fun fact: the identity verification systems the IRS uses are made by credit-rating agency Equifax. The system, known as Knowledge-Based Authentication, or KBA, asks questions based on a person’s credit history, such as “On which of the following streets have you lived?” or “What is your total scheduled monthly mortgage payment?”\n",
      "If that’s not enough Quartz reports that in 2015, the Equifax KBA system was hacked in a data breach that resulted in the loss of more than 700,000 tax records.\n",
      "Former Equifax CEO Richard Smith was put in front of congressional committee hearing this week and apologized for mistakes which led to the massive breach.\n",
      "Smith additionally called for an end to Social Security numbers, claiming the country needed “to think beyond” the identifiers.\n",
      "“What is a better way to identify consumers in our country in a very secure way? I think that way is something different than an SSN, a date of birth and a name,” he said, according to Bloomberg.\n",
      "With two breaches under its belt including one involving an IRS system can any person state one valid reason to give Equifax a $7.25 million contract; and tell me how on earth the firm is still seen as “capable” to do the job?\n",

      "THE News IS: FILE PHOTO - The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Picture\n",
      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google has discovered Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on its YouTube, Gmail and Google Search products in an effort to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a person briefed on the company’s probe told Reuters on Monday.\n",
      "The ads do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-affiliated entity that bought ads on Facebook Inc (FB.O), but may indicate a broader Russian online disinformation effort, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss details of Google’s confidential investigation.\n",
      "The revelation is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the role that Silicon Valley technology giants may have unwittingly played during last year’s election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow’s goal was to help elect Donald Trump.\n",
      "Google has uncovered less than $100,000 in ad spending potentially linked to Russian actors, the source said.\n",
      "Both Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook recently detected and disclosed that suspected Russian operatives, working for a content farm known as the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Russia, used their platforms to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive in a bid to influence Americans before and after the November 2016 presidential election.\n",
      "The Internet Research Agency employ hundreds of so-called “trolls” who post pro-Kremlin content, much of it fake or discredited, under the guise of phony social media accounts that posed as American or European, according to lawmakers and researchers.\n",
      "Facebook announced last month it had unearthed $100,000 in spending by the Internet Research Agency and, under pressure from lawmakers, has pledged to be more transparent about how its ads are purchased and targeted.\n",
      "Google’s review had been more robust than ones undertaken so far by Facebook or Twitter, the source said.\n",
      "Russia’s ad purchases on Google were first reported by the Washington Post.\n",
      "Google, owned by Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), did not deny the story, and in a statement pointed to its existing ad policies that limit political ad targeting and prohibit targeting based on race or religion.\n",
      "“We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,” a Google spokeswoman said on Monday.\n",
      "‘DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY’\n",
      "Google, which runs the world’s largest online advertising business, had largely evaded public or congressional scrutiny until now. On Sunday, the Daily Beast news website reported that the Kremlin recruited at least two black video bloggers to post clips on YouTube during the campaign. They posed as Black Lives Matter sympathizers who were sharply critical of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n",
      "Though the videos were only viewed hundreds of times, they demonstrated for the first time that Russia allegedly deployed real people, not just fake online accounts or bots, to further spread propaganda.\n",
      "Congressional committees have launched multiple investigations into Russian interference, but concern about Silicon Valley’s role has surged over the past month against the backdrop of a cascade of revelations about how Russia appears to have leveraged their platforms to spread propaganda.\n",
      "A study published on Monday by researchers with the Oxford Internet Institute, which is affiliated with the British university, found that current U.S. military personnel and veterans were targeted by disinformation campaigns on Twitter and Facebook over the past year by a nexus of pro-Kremlin, Russian-oriented sites, along with conspiracy theorists and European right-wing ideologues.\n",
      "Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said Russia intended to sow discord in the United States, spread propaganda and sway the election. Some Democrats plan to introduce legislation to require internet companies to disclose more information about political ad purchases on their platforms.\n",
      "“If Vladimir Putin is using Facebook or Google or Twitter to, in effect, destroy our democracy, the American people should know about it,” Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said Monday on MSNBC.\n",
      "Google officials have been invited to testify publicly about Russian attempts to use their platforms to influence the election before both the House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 1 alongside Facebook and Twitter. While Facebook and Twitter have confirmed plans to attend, Google has not.\n",

      "THE News IS: CRAIOVA, Romania (Reuters) - NATO launched a new multinational force in Romania on Monday to counter Russia along its eastern flank and to check a growing Russian presence in the Black Sea following the Kremlin’s 2014 seizure of Crimea.\n",
      "The force will initially be built around a Romanian brigade of up to 4,000 soldiers, supported by troops from nine other NATO countries, and complementing a separate deployment of 900 U.S. troops who are already in place. The plans are to include additional air and sea assets to give the force greater capabilities.\n",
      "“Our purpose is peace, not war,” Romanian President Klaus Iohannis told the NATO Parliamentary Assembly of alliance lawmakers, which is meeting this year in Bucharest.\n",
      "“We are not a threat for Russia. But we need dialogue from a strong position of defense and discouragement,” he said, before flying to the Craiova military base in south-eastern Romania.\n",
      "At the base, as military bands played, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stood alongside Iohannis, addressed some of the troops in green face paint and inspected vehicles and weapons.\n",
      "“We are sending a very clear message: NATO is here, NATO is strong and NATO is united,” Stoltenberg told assembled Polish, Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese soldiers.\n",
      "Russia accuses NATO of trying to encircle it and threatening stability in Eastern Europe, which NATO denies. Around the Black Sea, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are NATO members while Georgia and Ukraine aspire to join.\n",
      "The NATO force aims to develop its presence in the Black Sea region, rich in oil and gas, without escalating tensions as it seeks to counter Russia’s own plans to create what military analysts say is a “buffer zone”.\n",
      "The 2008 Russian operation to put troops in Georgia’s South Ossetia region, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and its annexation of Crimea have raised the stakes, with all sides warning of a new, Cold-War style scenario.\n",
      "Apart from Romania, Poland is the biggest troop contributor. Bulgaria, Italy and Portugal will train regularly with the force in Craiova, and Germany is also expected to contribute.\n",
      "In additional to existing NATO Black Sea naval patrols, a maritime presence will include more allied visits to Romanian and Bulgarian ports, training and exercises.\n",
      "NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis arrive to review NATO multinational brigade in Craiova, Romania, October 9, 2017. Inquam Photos/Bogdan Danescu/via REUTERS\n",
      "Britain is deploying fighter planes to Romania. Canada is already helping to patrol Romanian air space, and Italian planes are helping patrol over Bulgaria.\n",
      "‘WEST BERLIN’ MODEL\n",
      "Some Eastern Europeans want NATO’s new ballistic missile defense shield, which includes a site in Romania, to be part of NATO’s eastern posture vis-a-vis Russia.\n",
      "Slideshow (5 Images)\n",
      "“The Aegis Ashore system would add another level of deterrence,” said Maciej Kowalski, an analyst at the Polish Casimir Pulaski Foundation, referring to the U.S.-built system.\n",
      "NATO says the system is to intercept any Iranian rockets.\n",
      "As in the Baltics and Poland, where the U.S.-led alliance has some 4,000 troops, NATO says the relatively light multinational model recalls allied support for West Berlin in the 1950s, when the presence of British, French and U.S. forces ensured the Soviet Union could not control all of Berlin.\n",
      "Under NATO’s founding treaty, an attack on one ally is an attack on all, meaning all 28 NATO nations would be required to respond in the case of any potential Russian aggression.\n",
      "While months in planning, the establishment of the force comes as Russia winds down its biggest war games since 2013. The Zapad, or West, games showed off Moscow’s latest weaponry and its ability to quickly mass forces on NATO’s borders.\n",
      "The enhanced NATO presence in Romania and Bulgaria marks a diplomatic success for Bucharest, which gained greater persuasive power because it is set to reach a NATO goal of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense this year, a priority for U.S. President Donald Trump.\n",
      "Romania pushed for bigger NATO naval presence on the Black Sea for more than a year, but found its neighbor Bulgaria wary of provoking Russia.\n",
      "Turkey supports only limited NATO reinforcements, concerned about breaking international rules limiting the scale of patrols in the Black Sea. Turkey has played down the extent of Russia’s militarization of Crimea, which NATO says involves deploying surface-to-air missiles and communications jamming equipment.\n",

      "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Shania Twain’s first studio album in 15 years debuted at the top of the Billboard album charts, while rocker Tom Petty’s death sent his music soaring back onto the U.S. charts.\n",
      "Twain’s album “Now” sold more than 137,000 copies in its first week, according to data on Monday from Nielsen SoundScan, almost double new releases by pop singers Demi Lovato and Miley Cyrus.\n",
      "Petty’s “Greatest Hits” album with his band The Heartbreakers, first released in 1993, sold some 83,000 units to take the No. 2 spot on the Billboard 200 a week after the “American Girl” singer died at age 66.\n",
      "The Billboard 200 chart tallies units from album sales, song sales (10 songs equal one album) and streaming activity (1,500 streams equal one album).\n",
      "Canadian country-pop crosssover Twain, 52, released “Now” after several years away from the studio following a struggle with Lyme disease and a tough divorce.\n",
      "Lovato’s “Tell Me You Love Me” bowed at No. 3 with 73,000 in sales, while Cyrus’s change of direction to a more folksy style with “Younger” debuted in fifth place with some 45,000 units sold.\n",
      "It was also a good week for Beyonce and fundraising for hurricane and earthquake disasters. The R&B singer’s remix of Spanish-language hit “Mi Gente” took the top spot on the digital songs chart, which measures online single sales.\n",
      "“Mi Gente,” in which Beyonce joined forces with Latin singer J.Balvin and Willy William, sold some 79,000 units, and rose 25 places on the charts.\n",
      "Beyonce, whose hometown Houston in Texas was badly hit by Hurricane Harvey in September, said she would donate her proceeds from the song and a new video to relief charities in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Caribbean islands after they were hit with three successive hurricanes, and an earthquake.\n",

      "(Reuters) - White nationalists briefly rallied on Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia, where violent clashes in August led to the death of a woman who was run down by a car.\n",
      "A few dozen white nationalists, led by so-called “alt-right” activist Richard Spencer and carrying torches gathered at Emancipation Park near a covered statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, the removal of which was blocked by a court pending the outcome of a legal challenge.\n",
      "Spencer posted a video on Twitter showing the protest, in which opponents of the removal of Lee’s statue chanted “You will not replace us” and “We will be back.”\n",
      "Charlottesville’s Mayor Mike Signer fired off an angry response on Twitter, telling Spencer and the protesters to “go home.”\n",
      "“Another despicable visit by neo-Nazi cowards. You’re not welcome here!,” Signer tweeted, adding “we’re looking at all our legal options. Stay tuned.”\n",
      "An August rally organized by white nationalists to protest the planned removal of the Lee statue turned deadly when counter-protester Heather Heyer, 32, was killed by a car driven into a crowd.\n",
      "The violence stemmed from a heated national debate about whether Confederate symbols of the U.S. Civil War memorialize past leaders and dead soldiers or rather invoke white supremacy and the Confederacy’s acceptance of the slavery of blacks.\n",
      "In the wake of the rally, other cities have acted to remove monuments to the Confederacy.\n",

      "THE News IS: Garcia has now won five titles on the WTA tour\n",
      "France's Caroline Garcia beat new world number one Simona Halep to win the China Open and overtake Briton Johanna Konta in the race for Singapore.\n",
      "Unseeded Garcia edged Romanian Halep 6-4 7-6 (7-3) for her second successive title after victory at the Wuhan Open.\n",
      "She hit 17 winners and saved nine break points in the second set to move into the eighth and final qualifying spot for the tour finals.\n",
      "Konta must now reach the final in Moscow to have a chance of overtaking.\n",
      "Britain's Konta will play in the Kremlin Cup, which begins on 16 October, but Garcia has put herself in pole position with a hard-fought victory over Halep.\n",
      "Halep moved to the top of the world rankings following her semi-final victory over Jelena Ostapenko on Saturday, and broke Garcia in the first game of the final.\n",
      "But Garcia immediately broke back, before battling to take a tight first set.\n",
      "Halep then wasted countless opportunities in the second before her final shot in the tie-break sailed well wide to hand Garcia the title.\n",
      "Analysis\n",
      "BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller\n",
      "As a result of winning the title in Beijing - a week after winning the autumn's other big event in Wuhan - Caroline Garcia has now moved 185 points clear of Jo Konta in the eighth and final qualifying position for the WTA Finals in Singapore.\n",
      "Konta is not playing this coming week, and although Garcia plays again (as the top seed in Tianjin, she has drawn wild card Maria Sharapova in the first round), the race will definitely go to the final week of the season.\n",
      "Konta is due to play the Kremlin Cup in Moscow. Garcia is not currently entered, but is very likely to be offered a wildcard if she requests one.\n",
      "Either way, Konta must now reach the Moscow final to have any chance of making her debut in Singapore. And remember, she has lost in the first round of her last four tournaments.\n",
      "If not, she will be first alternate, so there is always the possibility she could still get into the draw if one of the top eight picks up a serious injury in the next two weeks.\n",

      " \n",
      "One of the many problems with Facebook is that one of its updates has included giving the app access to your microphone when you use Facebook Messenger. While the excuse Facebook gave was that it needed access to the microphone in order to shoot live video within the app, the idea that Facebook has access to your smart phone’s microphone at all times is unsettling, to say the least.\n",

      "iPhone users are all too familiar with the virtual friend living inside their smartphone, and while users often ask Siri a range of random questions, she is always listening—and even if the device is locked, saying “Hey Siri,” records your request and uploads the audio file to Apple’s servers for processing.\n",
      " \n",
      "For iPhones using iOS 8 and later, Apple has made it so that even when the device is locked, the command of “Hey Siri” will activate the feature and give access to the phone. However, if you have experienced this new feature, you may have found that there are times when Siri is activated, even though you did not intentionally give the command.\n",

      "THE News IS: On Sept. 29, 2001, in its first episode after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the show opened with remarks from Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the mayor of New York, who thanked members of the New York Fire Department, Police Department and Port Authority Police Department. Paul Simon then played his Simon & Garfunkel song “The Boxer.”\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "The episode broadcast on Dec. 15, 2012, which followed the shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, opened with the New York City Children’s Chorus singing “Silent Night.”\n",
      "Weekend Update’s Bit of the Week\n",
      "The co-anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che both delivered pointed comic monologues that advocated for gun control.\n",
      "Mr. Jost opened the segment by saying, “The investigation into the tragedy in Las Vegas this week has sparked a larger debate in America, between people who want common-sense gun control, and people who are wrong.”\n",
      "He continued:\n",
      "This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. The guy had 47 guns. No one should own 47 of anything. If you own 47 cats, you are not a responsible pet owner, you’re a crazy cat lady. And unlike with guns, the government will actually come and take your cats away because everyone agrees that’s insane. Also, this guy bought 33 of his guns in the past year, and that didn’t set off any kind of alert? If I buy $100 worth of Chick-fil-A, I get a text message from my bank that says, ‘Did you just purchase $100 worth of Chick-fil-A? Please, Colin, tell us this is fraud.’ How is no one keeping track of how many guns people own? There is a real law in Texas that says it’s illegal to own more than six dildos. And I get why. No one needs that many. If you have more than six dildos, it’s a clear sign you are training for something awful.\n",
      "Mr. Che asked, “Why is it so hard to get gun control in this country?” His monologue continued:\n",
      "“Who are these delicate snowflakes that we can’t just tell: ‘No, you’re not allowed to have 40 guns anymore, Earl. From now on, you can have one gun, max. And six bullets.’ If you can’t hit what you’re shooting with six bullets, then you don’t need to be shooting at it. Learn karate or use your words. I’m sick of this narrative that Americans just love guns so much. It’s not true. Seventy-eight percent of Americans don’t even own a gun. And 3 percent of Americans own 50 percent of all the guns in the country. That’s the problem: that whiny 3 percent that needs to feel secure all the time. That’s why I think we should do a buyback program. For every gun you trade in, we give you one half-inch of penis enlargement. That’s fair. If you trade in 10 guns, you get five more inches. And if women want to trade in their guns, don’t. Keep your guns. You’re probably going to need it to fight off all those men in spandex showing off their brand-new eight-inch penises.”\n",
      "Mr. Che joked, “Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that he wants Congress to look into some proposals for gun control. But first he wants to look into this briefcase from the N.R.A.” Here, an onscreen graphic showed a National Rifle Association briefcase full of money.\n",
      "Missing Subject of the Night\n",
      "“S.N.L.,” which was hosted by the “Wonder Woman” actress Gal Gadot, conspicuously avoided the subject of Harvey Weinstein, the powerful film producer who is facing decades’ worth of sexual harassment accusations. The apparent reluctance of the late-night shows to address the issue — as of Friday night, only “The Daily Show” had made a single oblique reference to the accusations — has rankled some critics of these programs, who say it is hypocritical of them to have mocked figures like Bill O’Reilly and Roger Ailes of Fox News and even Mr. Trump for sexual harassment accusations while ignoring a prominent, politically liberal transgressor.\n",
      "Kate McKinnon’s Role of the Week: Doing the ‘Gins-burn’\n",
      "During “Weekend Update,” Ms. McKinnon reprised her role as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom she plays as a kind of saucy insult comedian. Talking about a gerrymandering case that the United States Supreme Court is considering, Ms. McKinnon said of Republicans, “Hello, we see what you’re doing. It’s like they’re at a cocktail party, they’re taking all the shrimp. And all the Democrats are left with is the sweaty cheddar. By the way, sweaty cheddar is what they called Steve Bannon in college. Ouch! That’s a nasty Gins-burn.”\n",
      "Addressing Ms. Ginsburg’s own longevity, Ms. McKinnon said: “Joke’s on you. I made a deal with our female God that I would trade height for years. So in 2095 I’m going to be the size of a Playmobil, but I’ll still be kicking ass and taking Boniva.”\n",
      "Pete Davidson’s Joke of the Night\n",
      "In a “Weekend Update” routine, Mr. Davidson discussed his recent disclosure that he had been given a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, which he described as a form of depression. He talked about strategies he could use to keep himself healthy, among them: “If you’re in the cast of a late-night comedy show, it might help if they, you know, do more of your sketches,” he said. “The show is, like, eight hours long and there’s, like, 50 sketches a week. It seems weird you wouldn’t use one of them to fight mental illness, but I guess that’s not your style.”\n",
      "When Mr. Jost suggested to Mr. Davidson that he should write more sketches, Mr. Davidson answered: “That won’t work. My sketches suck because they’re all written by a depressed person.”\n",

      "THE News IS: With a Yankee bullpen that now seems taxed — David Robertson and Chad Green have not looked the same since their long stints in the wild-card playoff game last week and Dellin Betances has been erratic — Manager Joe Girardi said he was ready to count on Chapman for two innings on Wednesday night, something he did just once during the regular season.\n",
      "Chapman will not be the only one forced to confront his past when Game 5 begins. The Indians, too, are dealing with the fact that they are back to a similar point they were a year ago.\n",
      "In the 2016 World Series, the Indians had a three-games-to-one lead over the Cubs and three chances to finish them off, including a deciding game in their home park. They couldn’t do it.\n",
      "Against the Yankees, the Indians had a 2-0 lead in this series and failed in their first two chances to close out the series. Their third, and final, chance will come at home.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "Indians Manager Terry Francona, who managed the Boston Red Sox when they staged an epic comeback from a 3-0 deficit against the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series, pointed to the capricious nature of these series and the fine margin between winning and losing.\n",
      "“There’s a lot going on in between that I think people lose sight of,” Francona said. “I don’t think you’re just either dumb or smart, or good or bad. Sometimes there’s some gray there.”\n",
      "The same could be said for Chapman.\n",
      "There has existed, throughout a major league career that began in 2010, an air of imperviousness about him. It is owed not just to a fastball that once touched 105 miles per hour, but also to his chiseled, athletic frame and his dispassionate demeanor on the mound, with a smile that more closely resembles a sneer. Never did he evoke a sense of vulnerability.\n",

      "If Game 7 of the 2016 Series opened a hole in that armor, so, too, has this season.\n",
      "It began with Chapman coming back to the Yankees after signing a five-year, $86 million free-agent contract last December, the longest and most lucrative ever for a reliever. But in May, Chapman went to the disabled list for a month with a sore shoulder and in August he struggled so severely that he lost his role as closer.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "Many eyes were on Chapman when the Yankees demoted him, but Chapman did not complain. At pitching coach Larry Rothschild’s suggestion, he widened the grip on his fastball, sacrificing movement for command, and began to work his way back to form.\n",
      "Since returning to the closer’s role in early September, Chapman has not allowed a run in 14⅔ innings, including the postseason. The Indians, though, have challenged him. Jason Kipnis and Jose Ramirez singled off him in the ninth inning of Game 3, with the Yankees holding on to a 1-0 lead. Carlos Santana then drove a 3-2 fastball just short of the warning track in left field for the final out.\n",
      "The Indians forced Chapman to throw 26 pitches in that inning — 23 of which were fastballs that were 100 m.p.h. or faster.\n",
      "“It’s a different at-bat than you’ll see versus most pitchers,” Kipnis said before Game 4. “You just have to pay attention to what he’s trying to do that night. Is he in love with his fastball because it’s hitting 103, or is he trying to establish a little bit of a slider?”\n",
      "He added: “You watch what he’s doing and he’s not just a guy that you literally take any direction with. You don’t try to pull. You don’t try to spray. You literally just try to see the ball over the plate and get the barrel to it.”\n",
      "Often lost in last year’s Game 7 is that Chapman — who had little life left on his fastball after throwing 42 pitches in Game 5 for the Cubs and another 20 in Game 6 — set the Indians down in order in the ninth inning with the score tied. In that instance, he leaned heavily on his slider and changeup. Then the rains came, allowing the Cubs to regroup, and Heyward to make his impassioned speech. Chicago won the title in the 10th.\n",
      "Many things will have to go right for the Yankees on Wednesday night, beginning with solving what promises to be a much sharper Corey Kluber. Aaron Judge, who has struck out 12 times in 15 at-bats in this series, may need to get a big hit with the game on the line. But if the Yankees are in a position to cap their comeback, it is hard to imagine a scenario where Chapman isn’t standing on the mound at the end, trying to finish off the Indians — and his own ghosts.\n",

      "(Before It's News)\n",
      "Killer Tracks today announces that I Can, We Can and Love +, will be released this month via the Killer Tracks Artists Series. A percentage of the revenue from the licensing of the songs will go to Mike Peters' Love, Hope, Strength Foundation which \"leverages the power of music to expand the bone marrow registry.\" Two more songs will be released later this year. The songs were written and sung by Mike Peters, whose band The Alarm produced more than 5 million records worldwide and 16 Top 50 UK singles. Peters is himself a cancer survivor and the subject of a new documentary, The Man in the Camo Jacket, directed by Russ Kendall and produced by Jonathan McHugh, Jonathan Platt, James Chippendale, Alex Colletti and Stash Slionski. The film chronicles Peters' 8-year battle with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A special screening of the film will be held on August 3rd at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, followed by a short musical performance and Q&A. Peters and The Alarm are currently headlining this year's Warped Tour, which includes a stop in Pomona, California on August 6. Love Hope Strength, named after The Alarm's 1985 anthem Strength, will have representatives at each Warped Tour date conducting swab drives and donor matches. To date, Love Hope Strength has added over 150,000 individuals to the bone marrow registry, and has created over 3,100 potential life-saving matches for patients around the world.

      "THE News IS: By Janet Phelan\n",
      "On the surface, the plan was simple and straightforward, and fueled by the best of motives. After hearing for months about attacks on growing numbers of American citizens who claim they are being assaulted with unconventional weapons, Pastor S. (name withheld on his request), a pastor at an evangelical church in India, decided to take definitive action.\n",
      "His plan was to travel to the US, to meet with other pastors, including Dallas pastor Chuck Pierce, who purportedly has the ear of President Trump. S. was going to lay out the types of attacks that individuals are now reporting and ask the President to make sure that the intelligence agencies stop their non-consensual testing of these weapons, including microwave and sonics, on selected American citizens.\n",
      "What Pastor S. did not gamble on, however, was the massive surveillance apparatus of these intelligence agencies, which apparently swung into gear in order to effectively stop him in his tracks.\n",
      "S. flew into Dallas International Airport on September 4, buoyed by the prospects of a potentially successful good will mission. He didn’t get any further than the airport, however. He was stopped upon deboarding and subsequently interrogated and detained by Customs and Border Protection for over 24 hours. His visa to the US—previously good until 2020—was summarily canceled and he was put on a plane back to India, by way of Dubai.\n",
      "No meetings with Chuck Pierce and no meetings with Trump. Pastor S. reports that he was held in a cell and denied appropriate food for over 24 hours. He also states he was denied access to the Indian Consulate and also forced to pay for his trip back, contrary to protocols. His return ticket—for about a month later—was not honored by Emirates Airline and upon landing in Dubai, where he was to change planes to India, he was threatened with arrest if he did not pay for that flight.\n",
      "Upon reaching his final destination in India, he was again threatened with arrest for non-payment of the ticket. He reports that his luggage and passport were seized by Emirates Airline, as collateral until he paid the full fare.\n",
      "CBP has protocols in place for the removal of an unwanted person. The press office for CBP stated:\n",
      "According to the Immigration and Nationality Act, a traveler who arrived at a U.S. port of entry and is ordered removed shall be removed by the owner of the aircraft on which the traveler arrived to the United States. The law further states that the owner of the aircraft on which the traveler arrived in the United States shall pay the transportation costs of removing the traveler.\n",
      "Emirates appears to have taken unusual steps in violating this Act. When contacted concerning reports that Emirates staff had threatened S. and had seized his belongings, Emirates issued this terse statement:\n",
      "We do not discuss individual passenger cases for privacy reasons. Emirates has no jurisdiction over decisions made by the authorities when it comes to visa and entry requirements.\n",
      "According to CBP, Pastor S. was denied entry because “he intended to work” in the US and his visa disallowed this. CBP states that “A valid visa does not guarantee entry into the U.S. There are many reasons for a person to be denied entry. In this case, CBP officers determined that Mr. ******* was traveling with a tourist visa but intended to work which is not authorized when visiting the U.S. as a tourist.”\n",
      "However, S. maintains that there was no gainful monetary aspect to his trip to the US. He also denies the assertion by the press office at CBP that he was given the opportunity to contact the Indian Consulate.\n",
      "According to the Pastor, he was offered only red meat to eat during his detention in Dallas, which for religious reasons he declined. Upon arriving back in India, he was so weak from lack of nourishment that he was hospitalized (he is diabetic).\n",
      "According to NSA whistleblower Karen Melton Stewart, who helped raise funds for this mission to the US, he has gone into seclusion in India in order to recover from the mistreatment.\n",
      "Stewart states that he is now traumatized. “He has been here four times before and was treated quite well,” says Stewart. “This time, he was treated like a criminal.”\n",
      "The Indian Embassy has requested a statement from the Pastor concerning his treatment in Dallas.\n",
      "Increasing numbers of individuals are now claiming assault by unconventional electronic weapons. The targets now include several former intelligence officers, who apparently fell afoul of the mandates of their agencies. A recent mainstream news report states that US diplomats in Cuba were also assaulted by sonic weapons, which buttresses allegations which had previously been consigned to the “conspiracy culture.”\n",
      "Janet Phelan is an investigative journalist and author of the groundbreaking exposé, EXILE. Her articles previously appeared in such mainstream venues as the Los Angeles Times, Orange Coast Magazine, Long Beach Press Telegram, etc. In 2004, Janet “jumped ship” and now exclusively writes for independent media.

      "THE News IS: A volcano near Bali has sent thousands of villagers in an evacuation mission as it is widely believed that the volcano could erupt, the last one having taken place nearly 50 years ago.\n",
      " \n",
      "Bali on high alert after tremors around Mount Agung volcano\n",
      " \n",
      "Tourists have been alerted to not go in hiking or camping expeditions anywhere close to the volcano site, with authorities highly recommending staying away for at least 4 miles (6 kilometers). The volcano is known as Mount Agung, and it has made the earth shake and tremble, with smoke spouting from its gaping crater as vividly witnessed by bystanders. The site is located 3 kilometers above sea level, roughly 9,840 feet.\n",
      " \n",
      "Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the National Disaster Management Agency, had this to say about the possible calamity, \"Volcanic activity remains high and there are indications of magma rising to the surface and causing tremors There should be zero public activity within the specified radius in case there is an eruption.\"\n",

      "Active Volcano Mount Agung Erupts (1963)\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "Still, some native folks did not wish to be evacuated, preferring to stay. Some of these villagers were situated at the base of the mountain which the volcano calls home. Other tourists even preferred to witness the volcano with the possible danger of eruption!\n",
      " \n",
      "One villager named Wayan Suarda had this to say during a live television interview by channel tvOne, \"I'm here with my husband. We need to feed the animals, so that's what we're doing first.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "<img src=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/8976390-3x2-700x467.jpg\">\n",
      " \n",
      "The volcano is located in the country of Indonesia, which is just alongside the deadly 'Pacific Ring of Fire, ' infamously named because its geographical position lends itself to dangerous tectonic activity. It is estimated in a recent US Geological Survey, that 90% of the earth's seismic activity takes place because of this fissure.\n",
      " \n",
      "The country itself has close to 130 active volcanoes, easily beating out other countries for most in the world.\n",
      " \n",
      "The last eruption for Mount Agung took place between 1963 and 1964. It was a chain of eruptions that devastated the land and led to more than 1,000 people and countless other reported injured.\n",
      " \n",
      "It has been reported by some villagers that the eruption is the result of a secret cult that recently started to spread itself in the country. One villager, who wished to remain anonymous for safety purposes, stated that the cult has been holding strange rituals at sites near the volcano. While most authorities cannot verify this fact with absolute certainty, many tourists have noted that loud chants can be heard at night when the moon can be seen from the sky.\n",
      " \n",
      "A group of tourists recently attested that they witnessed the cult amidst one such ritual. One of their members, a German from Frankfurt, went on to say that the ritual involved the skinning of animals, mostly rodents, interesting dances around a fire, and the calling of a familiar name in Asian culture: Shiva.\n",
      " \n",
      "It is not known whether there is any connection between the volcano being awakened and the manifestation of the cults, but it still is a rather ominous sign, with some villagers vowing to investigate further to prevent more calamities from taking place.\n",

      "THE News IS: Love Hope Strength Band Announces Partnership With Killer Tracks\n",
      "(Before It's News)\n",
      "Killer Tracks today announces that I Can, We Can and Love +, will be released this month via the Killer Tracks Artists Series. A percentage of the revenue from the licensing of the songs will go to Mike Peters' Love, Hope, Strength Foundation which \"leverages the power of music to expand the bone marrow registry.\" Two more songs will be released later this year. The songs were written and sung by Mike Peters, whose band The Alarm produced more than 5 million records worldwide and 16 Top 50 UK singles. Peters is himself a cancer survivor and the subject of a new documentary, The Man in the Camo Jacket, directed by Russ Kendall and produced by Jonathan McHugh, Jonathan Platt, James Chippendale, Alex Colletti and Stash Slionski. The film chronicles Peters' 8-year battle with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A special screening of the film will be held on August 3rd at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, followed by a short musical performance and Q&A. Peters and The Alarm are currently headlining this year's Warped Tour, which includes a stop in Pomona, California on August 6. Love Hope Strength, named after The Alarm's 1985 anthem Strength, will have representatives at each Warped Tour date conducting swab drives and donor matches. To date, Love Hope Strength has added over 150,000 individuals to the bone marrow registry, and has created over 3,100 potential life-saving matches for patients around the world. I Can, We Can and Love +, are vintage Mike Peters: idealistic, impassioned, soaring. \"They are very inspiring and motivating songs, and fantastic additions to our Artist Series,\" says Killer Tracks VP of Production Carl Peel. \"We are very excited to collaborate with Mike and support the work of his wonderful foundation.\" \"Killer Tracks continues to support great causes and great artists,\" adds McHugh. \"Partnering with Mike Peters and Love Hope Strength in helping to promote his film and music has been a blessing.\" Film and television licensing of I Can, We Can and Love + is available exclusively through Killer Tracks.

      "You only have to look at driving signs in Sydney to see that. It takes a minute to read them. I think it might even be illegal to read them, such are the risks to your health and other road users’ health.\n",
      "Who decides the rules, and who are the ‘risky’ subjects? You mentioned those of overseas cultures, but I would add Indigenous Australians and drug addicts to the mix. So often rules are made that make middle-class mums and dads feel safer and more assured, even though they and their families were rarely, if ever, affected by the activities the rules limit or outlaw.\n",
      "— Ned Cooper\n",
      "Larrikins United\n",
      "I’m really surprised at your impression re. rule breakers versus rule followers. I break every rule under the sun, have done so all my life (I’m 66) and I think that pretty much all my peers do the same. So I guess it’s a matter of perception.\n",

As as woman of more than 70 years I had to insure myself against pregnancy, among other things, in order to be approved. I raised this as a patent absurdity and was told, don’t worry, it’s not discrimination, men have to get the same insurance.\n",

      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "The reason Australians are sticklers for the rules, and the reason they are so hesitant to stray, is that they absolutely abhor the concept of personal responsibility in a way few other countries do.\n",
      "If something goes wrong, it’s not the person’s fault. Rather, it’s that the regulatory framework for that arena of human behavior isn’t effective enough. More laws! Won’t someone please think of the children.\n",

You will hurt the poor creature.” Of course they didn’t really understand English that well so just thought I was scared of the butterfly until I started waving my finger disapprovingly like a butterfly lover in distress.\n",
      "Afterward I did feel really bad, I felt terrible for making someone feel bad when they were just appreciating nature’s wonders, especially a visitor. Maybe it was the closet zoologist in me, who completed the degree but never worked a day in the field, trying to do my bit for animal conservation.\n",
      "I found myself being extra polite as we passed each other many more times in the tight confines of an overcrowded butterfly house, insisting the elderly mother go before me as we both approached the exit.\n",
      "I think next time I’ll try to resist the impulse and leave it to natural selection; the butterfly did fly off unharmed of course.\n",

      "Whilst I completely agree that some “rules” need to be modernised, such as marriage equality, some rules shouldn’t, like don’t grab a butterfly wings! Which at the end of the day is exactly the same thing … freedom.\n",

      "Immigrants Seeking Guidance\n",
      "I think your daughter was right.\n",
      "You should have, with the greatest of courtesy, drawn their attention to the “no feeding” rule. If they had been reasonable people they would have been grateful to you for pointing it out.\n",
      "Speaking as a long-term immigrant to Britain, I can say through personal experience that often it is not a case of (usually newly arrived) immigrants not following the rules. It’s a case of not knowing what the rules are: standing in a queue, not throwing litter out of a car, not interrupting while someone is speaking, remembering to top and tail requests with “please” and “thank you.”\n",
      "It is not that we have some fundamental objection to doing (or not doing) these things: It’s more that often we don’t know what needs to be done. Somebody please tell us — we want to learn, and through learning save ourselves some embarrassment!\n",
      "— Vani K. Borooah\n",
      "Rules and Images\n",
      "Another interesting quandary I have encountered in my career as a teacher is of migrant families requesting a school for a white Australian blue-eyed blonde teacher for their child over a “brown” teacher — it makes for a proud display of the class photo to relatives back home, signaling they have finally “arrived” in Australia and raising their prestige in society.\n",
      "Would this classify as a hangover of colonization, discrimination or market forces in the independent education sector, where if you are paying exorbitant school fees you can bend the rules to get what you want?\n",
      "— Ipshita Nair\n",
      "Don’t Rock the Boat\n",
      "In not calling someone out on breaking the rules, it’s because it’s much less hassle and it’s being “too serious” and the rule being broken is “harmless.”\n",
      "It’s just bread. It’s just food. It’s not a big deal. It’s just a couple of kilometers over the limit, it’s just some paper with your name signed on it and a label of “married.”\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "This extends from all manner of interpersonal interaction on the social and professional level all the way into our politicians — who are too busy calling each other names for a laugh than being serious for five minutes.\n",

      "The problem is, we don’t really draw a line.\n",
      "That’s because we can’t help but want to fit into the way our society runs — the casual, hands-off, “nah, she’ll be right mate” approach to everything that is so deeply ingrained in our culture that we struggle to care enough to change anything for fear of being called out — not for breaking the rules, but for disturbing the peaceful, carefree status quo we’ve established.\n",
      "— David Tillett\n",
      "‘Compliance Nation’\n",
      "I am not suggesting that we become a nation of rule breakers but Australia is truly a “Compliance Nation” progressively getting worse. And unfortunately a general ambivalence by the population is letting it happen.\n",

      "The Weinstein Scandal\n",
      "A New York Times investigation that chronicled a hidden history of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein continued to ripple through Hollywood all week. By Sunday evening, his entertainment company fired him. Then new accusations emerged.\n",
      "Several actresses have now come forward and spoken to or emailed my colleagues about their own experiences with Mr. Weinstein. “We’re at a point in time when women need to send a clear message that this is over,” Gwyneth Paltrow said. “This way of treating women ends now.”\n",

      "A Rohingya Massacre\n",
      "The suffering of Myanmar’s Rohingya minority continues, with another swell of refugees fleeing to Bangladesh this week. Our South Asia bureau chief, Jeffrey Gettleman, recently spent time in the camps documenting what many there describe as massacres and atrocities targeting women and children.\n",
      "To put the crisis in context for our Australian readers, I interviewed two other Times reporters, Hannah Beech and Ben C. Solomon, who have been covering the situation on the ground in Bangladesh.\n",

      "Uggs and Vegemite\n",
      "Those pesky Americans, why are they trying to trademark and pass off Aussie stuff as their own — like ugg boots? Jacqueline Williams reported the story of one Australian’s legal battle in the United States for the rights to Australia’s beloved ugly boots and it’s a David and Goliath story worth reading.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "We also wrote this week about the new Vegemite, and the Australian government’s efforts to move refugees from Manus to Nauru.\n",
      "“We do not know what is our sentence,” one of the refugees on Manus told us. “We do not know how many more years we will have to be kept hostage in here.”\n",

      "• Greg Dorfman argues that President Trump is changing the culture of Washington by violating the customs of language and approach that “are the scaffolding that supports the otherwise fragile words of our written Constitution.”\n",
      "• Peter Wehner, who served in the Bush White House, explores the divide over President Trump among conservatives, noting with humility that even he is caught up with “a severe case of confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one’s existing beliefs.”\n",
      "• Jason M. Barr explores why the world’s tallest buildings are rising all over Asia, especially in China.\n",
      "• Ruchir Sharma tries to calm our nerves about automation: “When new technology destroys, it leaves behind a layer of ash in which new jobs grow.”\n",

      "... And We Recommend\n",
      "Wondering what kind of work to pursue? Or how to design the life you want?\n",
      "Millie Tran, our global growth editor, recently shared a presentation she had put together on that topic, pulling from her own life and unorthodox career path. Many of her friends and colleagues (me included) found it valuable and insightful — and so rather than keep it private, someone smarter than me adapted it for the Smarter Living newsletter (sign up here).\n",
      "Read that version, or the view the presentation, which features links, questions and a strategy for women in particular.\n",
      "P.S. — On a related note, we just announced a new gender editor: Jessica Bennett, the author of “Feminist Fight Club.” I’ll be back at some point with more on Jess in this newsletter and in our Facebook group for subscribers, but here’s an interview with her that lays out what lies ahead.\n",

      "THE News IS: To the extent that her weekly 11 p.m. show is aimed at black viewers, Ms. Thede said, “I’m speaking to stories that matter to us.”\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "But her approach, she said, is the same one taken by the other members of late-night TV’s mostly white male fraternity. Those hosts, Ms. Thede said, “are speaking to the stories that they feel matter to them — they’re certainly not saying, ‘Women, don’t watch,’ or ‘Black people, don’t watch.’”\n",
      "What will ultimately bring an audience to “The Rundown,” Ms. Thede said, is the opportunity to laugh and “to get an authentic opinion about stories they’re not going to hear anywhere else.”\n",
      "The program is both a risky proposition and a potential breakthrough for BET, which has a sporadic history of late-night talk-show programming, and for Ms. Thede, who was most recently the head writer and an occasional performer on Comedy Central’s “The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore.”\n",
      "On a recent Wednesday morning, Ms. Thede was working out of her corner office in Midtown Manhattan, a work space furnished with a designer tick-tack-toe board and some down-market fidget spinners.\n",
      "As she prepared to shoot a test show later in the week, Ms. Thede noted several news stories that “The Rundown” could mine for material: professional athletes protesting racial injustice; O. J. Simpson’s release from prison; facial-recognition software that misidentifies black people.\n",
      "Ms. Thede explained, “We’re not going to spend a half-hour telling you Trump is bad, because black people didn’t vote for him anyway. They know that.”\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "“The Rundown” is BET’s first late-night talk show since “The Mo’Nique Show,” which ran from 2009 to 2011. Mo’Nique, the comedian and Academy Award-winning actress, was one of very few black women to have hosted such a program, including Wanda Sykes (whose Fox show ran one season in 2009-2010) and Whoopi Goldberg (whose show ran in syndication from 1992 to 1993).\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "Connie Orlando, BET’s head of programming, said in an interview that Ms. Thede had approached the network just when it was looking to expand its after-hours offerings.\n",
      "“It was something that made sense for the direction we’re going in,” Ms. Orlando said of “The Rundown.” “We realized our real prime time starts at 10, and our audience loves to laugh. It felt like the perfect moment to add the voice of an African-American female to the conversation.”\n",
      "Ms. Orlando said she believed the program’s topical content and viral potential would help it reach viewers who might not otherwise be watching BET.\n",
      "“The show’s going to cover anything from Cardi B to what’s happening in the White House,” she said, “and I think all kinds of audiences will be interested to know and listen to what Robin has to say.”\n",
      "Ms. Thede has broken ground here before: When she joined Mr. Wilmore’s “Nightly Show” as its head writer, she became the first black woman in late-night TV to hold such a title.\n",
      "Mr. Wilmore said in an interview that when he sought Ms. Thede for the job, “she was already getting ready to move to New York and knew, in her mind, that she had the job.”\n",

      "“That’s Robin’s personality,” Mr. Wilmore added. “Whatever happens in her mind is going to be real — she’s that strong of a thinker.”\n",
      "Ms. Thede grew up in Davenport, Iowa; her mother, Phyllis, is now a Democratic member of the state’s House of Representatives. Her father, Dave, a teacher, turned her on to the comedy albums of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy, and Ms. Goldberg’s performances on “Comic Relief.” Ms. Thede was named after Robin Williams.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "She performed in campus sketch-comedy groups while a student at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, and trained at the Second City improv theater in Chicago. Before she joined up with Mr. Wilmore, she wrote for several BET awards shows and its reality-TV satire “Real Husbands of Hollywood,” and was head writer of daytime TV’s “The Queen Latifah Show.”\n",
      "“The Nightly Show” provided Ms. Thede with opportunity and exposure. She was the head writer for Mr. Wilmore’s performance at the 2016 White House correspondents’ dinner, which drew some criticism when Mr. Wilmore referred to President Obama as “my nigga.”\n",
      "Today, Ms. Thede shrugs off any backlash. “Those jokes still hold up, and they’re genius,” she said. “I think that, in an age of Trump, history will be kinder to that performance.”\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "The abrupt cancellation of “The Nightly Show” in August 2016 was a gut punch but did not turn Ms. Thede off from late-night comedy.\n",
      "“I sold this show like two weeks later,” she said with a laugh. “I was sad, and I’m still sad — it felt like we should have been able to stay on through the election. But I wasn’t discouraged at all. I was empowered.”\n",
      "Though she never felt she had to compromise her voice at Comedy Central, Ms. Thede said that while she was there, “because you’re speaking to a majority-white audience, you are explaining things a little bit more from your perspective.”\n",
      "“On BET,” she continued, “I don’t have to take that step. I can just speak how I speak.” (Both BET and Comedy Central are owned by Viacom.)\n",
      "At its outset “The Rundown” will not feature any comic correspondents or celebrity guest interviews, just Ms. Thede’s satirical takes as well as skits and documentary segments that will feature her. (There will also be occasional pop-up concerts by surprise musicians.)\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "As she gets ready to take center stage, Ms. Thede is drawing inspiration from other late-night stars like Samantha Bee, of TBS’s “Full Frontal,” who, she said, naturally gravitates to subjects that other hosts overlook; and Jimmy Kimmel, of ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” who has offered his intensely personal perspectives on broader issues of health care and gun control.\n",
      "Mr. Wilmore, who has remained a friend of Ms. Thede’s, said the proliferation of topical comedy programs would make it challenging for “The Rundown” to find an audience, but not impossible.\n",
      "Recounting advice he had given Ms. Thede, Mr. Wilmore said, “Just be the best version of who you are onscreen, and whatever happens after that, you can’t really control. Either it’ll cut through that or it won’t. But the more you’re that, the better chance you have.”\n",
      "While Ms. Thede is mentally preparing herself for a healthy, 10-year run, she said she is already proud to have given jobs to candidates who had not previously worked in late night.\n",
      "By her own estimate, Ms. Thede said that on a staff of about 40, 75 percent were women and/or people of color, and she said several departments were headed by women.\n",
      "She stopped herself for a moment. “Headed by a woman? Is that a word? That sounds odd. It’s certainly not beheaded.”\n",
      "With wicked delight, Ms. Thede continued, “Unless they don’t do their jobs. I rule with an iron fist.”\n",

      "THE News IS: Broken2th And Crystal Sun Release “Castaliah”\n",
      "(Before It's News)\n",
      "The electronic indie pop album \"Castaliah,\" a collaboration between Broken2th and Crystal Sun, released digitally on July 17th. Mixed and mastered by Broken2th (Brian Frederick) at Hybrid Studios in Orange County, the record already has over three thousand plays on Spotify in its first two weeks. In addition to Broken2th and Crystal Sun, the album features artists like Donald Clay (The Pharcide) on keys, John Patrick Seedborg (Ronnie King) on trombone, and Vanessa Acosta (Bootleg Orchestra) on trumpet. \"I've been known primarily as an engineer for a long time, and with this project I wanted to step out of that shadow and into the role of composer / producer. Its important for an album to have continuity, to have a producer and an artist locked in sync to create a combined effort, and to create a work of art that represents what both want to say,\" said Frederick, \"This album took a few years to create, and we went through a lot of ups and downs. I think you can really hear that in the music.\" \"Castaliah\" has been in the works since 2012, with songs tracked around the country at various studios and locations along the way and finalized at Hybrid Studios. Crystal Sun and Broken2th are planning to release at least two more songs before the end of 2017 and have many more currently in the writing process. Frederick also plans on releasing a full-length album this year from Subtle Smiles, a collaboration with Marley Rae from Long Beach electronic soul band Bootleg Orchestra. You can hear \"Castaliah\" now on iTunes at https://itun.es/us/w-Kclb. About Hybrid Studios Hybrid Studios is a fully integrated multimedia production facility in Orange County, CA.

      "THE News IS: Institutional recognition of salary inequity between women and men for the same work. It’s hard enough being in a female-dominated field in a non-profit, which means that our work is already undervalued, but to watch the (very few) men in our line of work be rewarded beyond their qualifications or skill sets is extremely frustrating. Some might say it’s wrong. — Emily Edmonds-Langham, Brooklyn, N.Y.\n",
      "Affordable, quality childcare would be a game changer for not only myself and other women, but our entire country. Caring for and raising children is essential to society. However, parents and childcare workers are both undervalued for this important job. Caring for children more often falls on the shoulders of women, whether they are single or married, working or not. I have been all of these. For many single moms it can be totally unattainable to own a home, live in a safe neighborhood with good schools, give your kids nutritious food, and maintain a safety net in your savings account. For married moms, our partner’s paycheck is usually not enough to provide safety and security for our families.\n",
      "Childcare costs more than college in many states, so working to better ourselves isn’t even an option for some women who are starting at the bottom rung of the ladder-keeping us firmly stuck in the cycle of poverty. Women need access to quality childcare by well-paid childcare workers. We need onsite daycare when possible, flexible work schedules, quality subsidized childcare centers in every neighborhood no matter the income level. We need to start assigning actual monetary value to the raising of the citizens of this country! We could then bring ourselves and our kids out of paycheck to paycheck living, off of welfare, and into being valued and productive members of society. The payoff to our country would be enormous. — Rachel Jesequel, Beaverton, Ore.\n",
      "Equal Pay for Equal Work. I live in an area increasingly marred by inequality and very expensive cost of living due to housing and transit cost increases. My company is based in a part of the country which doesn’t reflect these issues such that my pay and living expenses aren’t reflective of reality on the ground. — Marea Murray, Oakland, Calif.\n",
      "An equal shot at the best jobs. In the early 80’s I saw starting my own business as the answer to running my own life. By 1993, I was tired of having to coddle young men who did not take responsibility, even when they had the job title and authority. I’ve run my own Engineering consulting company and done the quality work that my clients expect and appreciate. Most women engineers my age (75) retired by the age of 40. I’ve worked to make the world work for me, and intend to keep working and thinking as long as possible. — Caroline Reynolds, Austin, Tex.\n",
      "If my female boss and female colleagues stopped using my age as a reason to undermine my credibility, I would be able to accomplish everything I want to in my current job. I would be able to accomplish my goals in life if employers in the US do not hold my age against me when considering me for a position. — Patricia Kolman, Amman, Jordan\n",
      "I am in an exceedingly good situation. The only thing I want is to move closer to my job so I have a little more time for both work and my daughter. Living in Switzerland, a lot of the issues that would be a concern in the US are well dealt with. I have good childcare, am well-paid, and have a very flexible work schedule. Basically I am well set up to accomplish my goals this year. That was not always the case in the past.\n",

      "Generally I think we talk a lot about public policy initiatives, which are important though these are less issues for me since I have left the United States (which really does have a lot of work to do). What we don’t talk about are the negotiations that go on within a family. I think negotiations about where to live and how to divide time favor men’s careers. I don’t think we talk about this because it’s kind of faulting someone you love-and often someone who tries to support their partner 100% but just doesn’t see the ongoing asymmetries. Women’s economic equality depends on negotiations in all 3 spheres: public policy, workplace, and family. — Debra Hevenstone, Switzerland\n",
      "I feel like I am facing bias and prejudice because I am a woman in my 30s. Employers are hesitant to hire women my age because we might get pregnant. I live in Austria, where there are very strong laws protecting mothers, providing paid maternity leave, etc. At the same time the country is quite conservative. It makes it harder to find work between 30-40. — Manuela Bateman, Innsbruck, Austria\n",
      "Being taken seriously and accepted as a human being and not pointed as ‘a woman’ for whatever it is I am doing, like as if it was some kind of genetic disease. Women are half of the human population and still, they have to be treated as a minority. In the Western World, we deal with politicians discussing special laws for the female population, debating whether it is fair or not to pay them for their work or if it is socially adequate to talk about their body functions. As a young woman, it would be much appreciated to be looked at first of all for the goals I accomplish throughout my life rather than for my gender, body or name. The greatest help would be to be treated equally as any other man on the planet. No more, nor less than that. — Corinna Canali, The Hague\n",

      "Equal pay and equal opportunity (no discrimination) is an absolute place to start. As a disabled woman in Japan where business culture roots to traditional conservative practices with sexism, being a disabled women strictly limits career opportunity, advancement, and growth, regardless of educational background, skills, and achievement. There is a national requirement standard for corporations over 100 employees to include 2% disabled employees. However, most firms (especially large and global corporations) seclude disabled people into “special subsidiary” that is established just to employ people with disabilities. Career opportunities are limited, advancement and growth are limited. Pay are not equal with non-disabled and gender gaps (are believed to) exist. I feel that we are forced to accept the discouraging fact that people with disabilities are unwanted in the workforce.\n",
      "When I was a university graduate looking for entry level positions, a recruiter at a Japanese gaming firm recommended me to apply through the disabled section of their careers website. While the website mentioned accessibility benefits, there was only one employment type: Contractor.\n",
      "After a while, I was able to get an offer. However, the employment details were depressing: Salary was equivalent to high school graduates and 65% of peer new grad, on contract subject to annual renewal. Peer non-disabled new grads were accessible to full salary, benefits, and enjoy the status of permanent employment.\n",
      "Gender seemed to pay a significant role when it comes to salary negotiations and promotions. At a US-based firm, male employees were likely to get promoted, and faster, compared to female counterparts. When I asked for a salary rise along with a contract renewal, I was seen “greedy.” I couldn’t believe what the HR manager said to my face, “If we don’t renew your contract, what are you going to do?” - Sara Doi, Tokyo\n",
      "Being as equal in my home as I am outside of it. This year, I’ve had many discussions with women about the concept of cognitive load as it relates to sharing the responsibility of household management equally with their husbands. I’ve found it to be a common problem: we don’t just take care of 50% of the work in our homes; we also are the managers of the whole shebang. It’s exhausting and thankless, and knowing that (even without children!) I’ll be coming home to hours of more work affects my ability to put in extra time at my lab compared to male colleagues. — Elizabeth Sterling Lee, Edmonton, Canada\n",

      "The most important thing that would help anyone, man or woman, is not to have to stay in a job for the healthcare. If the US had government-provided healthcare (i.e., Medicare for all), people could do the work they want and not be tied to a job for the insurance! It would make entrepreneurship blossom! Of course, we will not see this within the next year. Realistically, I don’t know when we will see it happen. — Nadya Northrop, Chicago\n",
      "At the top of my list are issues related to childcare and life balance. I often consider the great problems women could address/solve if we had more time and affordable options for childcare. A share in the work of childcare would free women more at the workplace. I will also add that a greater respect for the needs of women to be with their kids outside of work, without penalty (be it via upward mobility or social/psychological penalty), such as leaving when a child is sick, attending a school event...etc. I will also add that some of my most supportive colleagues are women, especially those who also have children. Women need to band together to support our common and shared goals. There is power there. I have often thought that women need a more intentional and organized movement to fight for their rights and continued marginalization on our country. — Katherine Raichle, Seattle\n",
      "Having more bosses with school age children. Every boss I have ever had in 25 years working has either not had children or children who have left home. It is hard to confidently assert to a boss about why you don’t want to do hours of email once you are at home with family when they simply have got to where they are doing exactly that. It is hard when the role model in front of you for the next ladder of success is someone who has made sacrifices for sure but can’t necessarily relate to the ones most pressing on you. I lived in NYC for the first 10 years of parenting and had next to no friends with part time jobs since they all had to return to work so quickly after having children. In contrast the majority of my Australian female peers work part time as the 6-12 months leave they took at the beginning presented to them different options and created alternative pathways that didn’t seem possible in NYC. — Lisa Grocott, Melbourne, Australia\n",
      "Women are financially punished for caregiving. In my case, I took four years out of my career to care for my mother, who was dying of ovarian cancer. I’m an academic in the social sciences, so I kept one foot in the scholarly world by volunteering in the local public history sector — which was about all I could manage while on-call 24/7 for a cancer patient who underwent a major surgery, four rounds of chemo and one of radiation during that time, and who could no longer drive. My husband graciously supported me through it. But the gap in my CV effectively meant that any chance at a tenure-track was over.\n",
      "In the wake of my mother’s death, I have cobbled together several part-time jobs including adjuncting and paid work in public history, but with little security these jobs don’t count for much when you approach a bank for a loan to start a small business, which I’ve also recently done. Women who take time out to care for children face much the same. Not only is caring for the old and the young an unpaid and thankless job — it has punitive consequences. These jobs need to count — socially, culturally and economically — in the labor and financial sectors — as WORK, which is what they are. Vital and meaningful work, which produces the next generation of laborers and ensures that our sick, disabled and elderly are not thrown to the wolves. If we don’t do it, who will? And yet under capitalism, which commodifies just about everything else, we are expected to do this for free, and then excluded from opportunity when we do.\n",
      "What would help practically? In economic terms, there should be a social wage for these jobs, rather than women and their families absorbing the costs alone in lost wages. In cultural terms, caregiving should be a normal and acceptable line on a CV or resume, rather than a void of silence we fear having to explain when we attend a job interview. In social terms, we need to formalize this informal labor, give it a name and provide structural support for it. Oh, and need I say it? We need universal health care, so that no caregiver goes uncovered, or has to spend hours in paperwork and phone calls explaining to some bureaucrat why they don’t have a “real job.” - Dr. Eliza Jane Darling, Benson, N.Y.\n",
      "Idea generation in the fields such as social sciences, psychology, and philosophy is mostly controlled by large institutions, which in a way is good as it helps consolidating the common resources and attracts large-ticket outside financing, promotes collaboration among scholars and incentivize the contributors to contribute freely without worrying about expropriation or outright repudiation. However, this also precludes the independent scholars or individual contributors like me to participate actively. The institutional bodies financing the idea sharing forums should know that unaffiliated scholars face tremendous challenge in the absence of infrastructure available to institutional scholars. If they were contriving to make a meaningful contribution today with their scarce resources, the assistance to provide the opportunity of interaction would only improve the quality of their contributions in the future. Though there is no dearth of good ideas from within but if the idea from an independent source is good, it will be a good addition to the community of the scholars. In this case, I am averse to suggesting any women-centric special fund or forum to promote independent women scholars. Such special entity is more likely to restrict its own function, as it would fail to become the part of mainstream research community. Perhaps, a better inclusion policy from institutional side would be helpful in my case to make my ideas known to the wider audience. Nevertheless, I would continue with my readings, creating and relishing every moment of my work. — Charu Agarwal, Delhi, India\n",
      "I am a 37 year old college graduate who has yet to make over 16 dollars an hour since graduating from college. I’ve had little to no return on my liberal arts degree. I would like to go back to school for nursing but the thought of accruing more student loan debt on top of the 50k I already owe seems daunting. I also battle anxiety and depression and feel the resources I need to fight these often debilitating afflictions are often too expensive and when my doctor prescribes a certain medication that works for me the insurance companies deny and ask I try a cheaper, less effective medication.\n",

      "My goals this year are to find a job that pays me enough to live where I can afford to put a new tire on my car instead of having to ask my parents for the money because my paycheck is already stretched to the max. I want opportunities that equate to my intelligence, education and employment history. It’s all so very disheartening. I was told my whole life the key to success was to have a college degree. But, now...to be gainfully employed and make a living wage it seems you must be specialized. I want the stigma of mental illness to end. I want women to be able to openly discuss their issues without the worry of judgment. I want to go back to school to become a psychiatric nurse. I want to be able to afford to do so. — Kate Combs, Columbia, S.C.\n",
      "Probably the recognition that health care, equal pay and child care (among other things) are not just “Women’s Issues” or ideals that women should have to work harder to enact and accomplish. Recognition that women succeeding in business, or the home, without having to also think about “all of the things” every day actually (and has been proven) benefits everyone: their families, their companies, the bottom line, society as a whole.\n",
      "Recognition that things women generally advocate for are not for selfish reasons in the slightest. We want equal pay so we can support ourselves and our families in the same way our male counterparts do. We want decent healthcare so that when an emergency or illness hits us or our family, we can still focus on what needs to be done at work and at home to deal with it, and not wonder how we’re going to pay for it. We want affordable, quality childcare because in order to be successful at work, we need to be able to leave the most important things in our world at a place each day where we know they are loved, and nurtured and educated, and not at a price that makes it senseless for us to work in the first place.\n",

I remember the days of creating a spreadsheet with 15 options to figure out the most cost-effective plan (not good preventive care, BTW!). I know the CPT codes better than my insurance does and I still can’t get an amount for what something should cost and what may or may not be covered.

      "Health care and equal pay and treatment. I had my children when I had just joined the workforce after graduating from college. I paid $15 one time to cover all maternity fees (doctor and hospital). That was via a govt contractor in 2002 and 2004. Now, that would cost me over $8k. I also struggled to stay home for the allowed 12 weeks FMLA. Without disability insurance and savings, I don’t know how a woman with a career can afford to spend that time with her baby. I also experienced discrimination due to my pregnancy in a largely make environment. Including having statements made about my body, “I saw your butt getting bigger, so I assumed you were pregnant.” And statements saying that I needed to work longer and harder to “make up” for the time I was off. After a statement from a manger saying, “Decide whether you are a mother or employee,” I left. That was in 2007. I also missed the “raise” cycle since I was out with my children. We need to support women in all careers, including homemakers. Better child care options and paid maternity leave go a long way to helping. — Mandy Koons Gillespie\n",
      "Equal pay could likely ease child care costs a bit. But it would be incredible to see more options for flexibility in positions that are feasible for working remotely even just a few days a week. After changes to my remote schedule I would have been spending about 85% of my salary on childcare and so the solution we opted for as a family was for me to leave my corporate job and start my own business while caring for our 3 year old most days. That’s certainly had its pros and cons as well but I’ve heard so many of my female friends with children opt for leaving their job because childcare costs are so high and they’d either end up just breaking even or in some cases they would have ended up paying to go to work given what they would have had to pay for childcare. — Angel Hepp\n",

      "THE News IS: PARIS (Reuters) - A new museum showcasing the creations of late French couturier Yves Saint Laurent opens in Paris next week, offering visitors an intimate glimpse into his studio and how he pulled together his collections.\n",
      "Housed in the elegant Parisian building that was the seat of Saint Laurent’s eponymous label for 28 years, the museum includes displays of some of his most striking bejeweled dresses and the designs that defined his style.\n",
      "It recreates the workspace where Saint Laurent labored at his collections, an atelier filled with his sketches, rolls of fabrics and drawers full of beads and lace and which includes his original desk, complete with pin cushion.\n",
      "“This is more than a fashion museum, we’re opening up the house of an artist,” said Olivier Flaviano, the museum director.\n",
      "“You can find the spirit of Saint Laurent in the clothes, but also in the surroundings.”\n",
      "Drawings and photographs are seen on a wall at the Studio where all the collections were designed are seen inside the Yves Saint Laurent Museum in Paris, France, September 27, 2017. The new museum, celebrating the life and work of French designer Yves Saint Laurent (1936-2008), will open at the avenue Marceau address of his former work studio for almost 30 years. Picture taken September 27, 2017. REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\n",
      "The building includes the fitting room where clients once came to be measured.\n",
      "The museum had its official inauguration on Thursday and will open its doors to the public on Oct. 3, weeks after the death of Pierre Berge, Saint Laurent’s one-time partner and business associate.\n",
      "Slideshow (15 Images)\n",
      "Berge, a patron of the arts and well-known campaigner for gay rights, helped bring the label to prominence and was behind the project to launch the Yves Saint Laurent Museum.\n",
      "Another museum dedicated to the designer is due to open on Oct. 19 in Marrakech, Morroco. Saint Laurent often traveled there and drew inspiration from his visits.\n",
      "The designer was considered one of the 20th century’s most influential. He popularized tuxedo-style suits for women, known as “Le Smoking”, for instance, and made a transition from the world of haute couture to ready-to-wear clothes. He retired in 2002 and died six years later.\n",
      "The Saint Laurent label’s current creative director, Anthony Vaccarello, unveiled his latest spring-summer 2018 collection at Paris Fashion Week on Tuesday evening, in a spectacular outdoor display with a lit-up Eiffel Tower as its backdrop.\n",

      " \n",
      "The strength of the EMP is determined by the height at which it is created, such an EMP would have devastating consequences. It would destroy our electrical grid.

      "Those events may be alarming but they would be survivable by most. The real danger of an EMP event lies elsewhere. It is a danger that turns an EMP into an ELE. An extinction level event. It's a threat not many dare to mention. Only whispered about in certain circles and some of the more serious survivalist blogs.\n",
      " \n",
      "That danger is posed by our nuclear power plants. Littered across the country the United States has over 100 nuclear power plants scattered around the nation. Nuclear power plants are depedant on the main grid. All of those facilities would quickly go into meltdown as their back up systems fail. The time frame would be anything from 24 hours to four weeks.\n",

      "You can’t keep a good Superman down. That seems to be the message of the new trailer for “Justice League.” It opens with a shot of Henry Cavill’s Man of Steel — who sacrificed his life last year in “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” — appearing in a dream to his love interest, Lois Lane (Amy Adams). Later, after scenes of apocalyptic destruction and attacks by winged creatures, Batman (Ben Affleck) growls of his former foe: “The world needs Superman.”\n",
      "But does the world need “Justice League”? The superhero conglomerate was traditionally called the Justice League of America, but Warner Bros. opted to drop the last part, perhaps in an attempt to appeal to a global audience. The filmmakers also hope to broaden their reach by striking a more lighthearted tone after critics derided “Batman v. Superman” for its humorlessness.\n",
      "Sounding like a superfan at New York Comic Con, the Flash (Ezra Miller) geeks out over the sight of the Bat signal: “That’s so cool!” The jokey vibe may also reflect the contribution of Joss Whedon (“Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “The Avengers”), who stepped in to finish “Justice League” after the co-writer and director Zack Snyder left the project for personal reasons in May.\n",
      "The teaser features plenty of footage of Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman, whose stand-alone movie released in the summer has grossed more than $400 million in the United States alone.\n",
      "As Cyborg (Ray Fisher) tells Aquaman (Jason Momoa) after saving his life in the new movie, “The ride ain’t over yet.” Fans will find out if that holds true for the franchise when “Justice League” hits theaters on Nov. 17.\n",

      "THE News IS: VIELHA, Spain (Reuters) - If Catalonia declares independence from Spain this week, one community in the region’s mountainous north might declare independence from Catalonia.\n",
      "Most people in the picturesque Aran Valley - a semi-autonomous community nestled among the Pyrenees - want to stay with Spain, and the area has the right to self-determination under a law passed in 2015 by the Catalan parliament.\n",
      "“We’re a little spot on the map and often we’re not taken into account,” said Maria Verges Perez, the deputy mayor of Aran’s capital, Vielha, a cluster of stone-and-slate houses on the valley floor ringed by autumnal forests.\n",
      "“But we will exercise our right to decide our future.”\n",
      "Catalan President Carles Puigdemont is expected to declare independence on Tuesday in Spain’s worst constitutional crisis since the return of democracy in the 1970s.\n",
      "The roughly 10,000 people of Aran, on the border with France, have a language and culture distinct from the rest of Catalonia, which itself differs from the rest of Spain. The valley’s economy is heavily dependent on winter sports tourists from Spain and the EU.\n",
      "Their politicians say the 2015 law gives them the right to vote on whether they want to break away with Catalonia - something which Catalan officials do not dispute.\n",
      "The Spanish government has vowed to prevent Catalonia seceding. Losing the region would deprive the country of 16 percent of its people and a fifth of its economic output.\n",
      "But while Madrid insists Spain is indivisible under its constitution, the Aran Valley underlines the complex nature of nationhood in such a culturally diverse country.\n",
      "Ever since Spain’s return to democracy in the 1970s, Madrid has struggled to balance the country’s patchwork of regional identities, including its decades-long fight to quell separatism in the northern Basque Country led by violent militants ETA.\n",
      "Related Coverage Catalan govt to blame for companies' exodus from region: Spanish finance minister\n",
      "Few in the medieval villages along the Aran Valley doubt the community would opt to stay with Spain if asked to vote.\n",
      "“The people here feel very far away from what is going on in Barcelona,” said Carlos Barrera, head of the Aran government, at a rural festival in Salardu village where locals judged stocky Pyrenean horses and handed out racks of blood sausages.\n",
      "CROWN OF ARAGON\n",
      "The valley had the lowest voter turnout by far in Catalonia’s Oct. 1 independence referendum, which had been declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court.\n",
      "Across Catalonia there was a 43 percent turnout, with most people who wanted to remain in Spain staying home, and 90 percent of those who voted backed secession. In Aran, just 24 percent voted, with 84 percent of those backing independence.\n",
      "The valley traces its political allegiances back to pacts drawn up in the 13th century with the Crown of Aragon, a monarchy that would join with the Crown of Castille two centuries later to form what became Spain. Many locals speak Aranese, a dialect of the Occitan language still spoken in pockets of the Pyrenees and southern France.\n",
      "A man walks through the town of Vielha carrying a Spanish flag, in the Val d'Aran, Catalonia, Spain, October 7, 2017. REUTERS/Vincent West\n",
      "Two years ago, the Catalan parliament approved the “Law on Aran’s Special Status”, giving it control over its culture, language and administration and recognizing “the right of the Aranese people to decide their future”.\n",
      "A Catalan government spokesman said Catalonia would respect the Aranese people’s decision in any future referendum.\n",
      "A Spanish government spokesman declined to comment on whether Aran could remain part of Spain, saying Catalonia would never become independent.\n",
      "Aran’s residents are some of the sternest critics of the Catalan government which they say is ignoring those people who want to stay in Spain and charging toward independence at any cost.\n",
      "In Vielha, a lone red and yellow Catalan independence flag hanging from an apartment block was the only evidence last Saturday of the separatist fever sweeping many parts of the region, where cities convulse with protests triggered by Madrid’s violent crackdown on the referendum.\n",
      "Slideshow (17 Images)\n",
      "PRICE OF INDEPENDENCE\n",
      "Many people in Aran fear Catalan independence would destroy its tourism economy which revolves around Baqueira-Beret, Spain’s most popular ski resort.\n",
      "About two-thirds of the population in Aran depend on the ski resort for jobs. In the winter, the population triples with the influx of skiers drawn to the same slopes used by Spain’s royal family.\n",
      "Since the referendum, Verges Perez, the Vielha deputy mayor, said potential visitors had canceled almost 30 percent of hotel reservations for next week’s local holidays. And if an independent Catalonia was no longer part of the European Union, Aran’s reliance on agreements to use French hospitals for medical emergencies would be jeopardized, she added.\n",
      "“That’s the trap. Nobody has explained the price that independence like this would have,” she said.\n",
      "Many of Catalonia’s largest businesses have already said they are transferring their headquarters out of the region due to the political turmoil. Insurance firm Catalana Occidente, owned by the same family that owns Baqueira-Beret, is reportedly considering doing the same, although it has not confirmed it.\n",
      "The valley ranks as one of Catalonia’s wealthiest regions, thanks to a tunnel that opened it up to the rest of Spain in 1948. Before then, it was a poor area only accessible by an often snow-covered mountain pass.\n",
      "The valley’s politicians say holding their own referendum could be the only way to defend the local economy.\n",
      "But Jaime Geli, Salardu’s 72-year-old former mayor and one of the few independence supporters here, said locals shouldn’t be so quick to throw their lot in with Spain instead of sticking with Catalonia.\n",
      "Catalan authorities had protected the Aranese culture and language from a central government hostile to the idea that Spain is made up of different “nations”, he said, sat by the valley’s river.\n",
      "“In Madrid, when you talk to them about different languages, it makes their hairs stand up on end.”\n",

      "“For Ahkeem,” a documentary directed by Jeremy S. Levine and Landon Van Soest, grew out of a People magazine article from 2011 about the Innovative Concept Academy, an alternative school in St. Louis designed to rehabilitate teenagers who might otherwise be incarcerated. The film follows one such student over about two years.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "The movie begins with Daje Shelton, known as Boonie, then 17, visiting a courtroom after a school fight. The judge, Jimmie M. Edwards, who opened the academy, tells her that he will decide whether to lock her up. The alternative school is her last option for getting a high school diploma, he says. She won’t be able to attend other public schools in Missouri.\n",
      "“For Ahkeem” trails Boonie as she tries to graduate. It’s not clear that she will pass the necessary coursework. Her apparent apathy toward school seems, in part, like the product of a bleak upbringing filled with poverty and street violence. She casually rattles off the names of dead friends (“too many to count”). Boonie also has a boyfriend, which leads to complications that shouldn’t be spoiled.\n",
      "The filming period coincided with the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, and a grand jury’s decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the officer who shot him. The protests are mainly a backdrop to Boonie’s story, though. While the film ends at a logical stopping point, it feels incomplete. It probably could have used a few more years of filming.\n",

      "Titans receiver Rishard Matthews was one of many NFL players that felt personally attacked by President Donald Trump’s comments against the NFL and its protesting players, most notably the “son of a bitch” reference, and he now plans to use his platform to advance the protest, Cameron Wolfe of ESPN.com reports.\n",
      "“I plan to kneel until the president apologizes for the comments that he made because I felt like those were very disrespectful comments that he made,” Matthews said on ESPN’s NFL Live Tuesday. “The league is made up of I think over 70 percent of African-Americans so the people that would be kneeling for this cause would be African-Americans. To keep it honest, he was calling a lot of us and he was calling me an S.O.B. and that’s not OK and very disrespectful. So, I plan to kneel until the president apologizes.”\n",
      "President Trump was asked about his issue with the NFL at the White House on Tuesday and said he was “ashamed of what was taking place” with players kneeling during the national anthem.\n",
      "“I wasn’t preoccupied with the NFL, I was ashamed of what was taking place,” he said, adding that “the NFL situation is a very important situation.”\n",
      "“Many people have died, many people have been horribly injured and they were fighting for our country, our flag, our national anthem, and for people to disrespect that by kneeling during the playing of our national anthem I think is disgraceful,” he said.\n",

      "THE News IS: Many conspiracy theorists have searched for answers over the years regarding the assassination of John Kennedy. It was officially said that Harvey Oswald, a former marine had been the one who pulled the trigger and killed the president; however, this has been disputed by many.\n",
      " \n",
      "All Documents Relating To Assassination Should Be Revealed By 26 October 2017\n",
      " \n",
      "All of the documents for all of the entities of the government have been required by the Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act 1992 to be revealed to the public on 26 October 2017. However, the volume of documents with the name of “volume 5” might not get released and history will repeat itself.\n",
      " \n",
      "In July 3,810 documents belonging to the FBI and CIA about the assassination from the Assassination Records Review Board put out some revelations that researchers of the assassination had eaten up and publicized. An example from the documents was that Earle Cabell was the mayor of Dallas at the time of the assassination and he was an asset of the CIA during the 1950s and brother Charles Cabell had been a CIA high-ranking official until 1962.\n",

      "The whole 7-volume collection of the documents had been intact in 1977 and it was checked out by Russ Holmes, and it was said that the whole 7-volumes had been in the Office of General Counsel at that time. However, when the CIA was asked to turn over all of the documents on Lee Harvey Oswald, who was said to have been the one who pulled the trigger to kill the president, the agency stonewalled said investigator Malcolm Blunt.\n",
      " \n",
      "Blunt said that a big search by the CIA did not find the security files about Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination Records Review Board were not told about their existence. It was not until 1997 when a staff member of the ARRB came across evidence that two investigations by Congress had gained access to the files that the CIA managed to find the files.\n",

      "In 1998 Volume 5 Was Missing\n",
      " \n",
      "The 7-volume set was eventually received by the AARB in 1998; however, staff members found that volume 5 out of the 7 set was in fact missing. The agency said that perhaps volume 5 had been put together with volume 4 or 6. The agency came to the conclusion that there might not ever have been a volume 5 in the security files on Lee Harvey Oswald and in fact there were only 6 volumes.\n",
      " \n",
      "2017 has been the year that many conspiracy theorists have been waiting for as this was the year when the files on Lee Harvey Oswald might shed some light on the assassination. The Citizens against Political Assassinations is one group that has been waiting to get hold of the documents, including volume 5. They are of the belief that the narrative of the government is full of holes and it is something that needs to be looked into. A lot of the members of the group are lawyers, and many want to clear the name of Lee Harvey Oswald of any wrongdoing as they believe he was a scapegoat.\n",

      "The Warren Commission Called The Original Fake News Organization\n",
      " \n",
      "Schnapf is on the CAPA legal committee, and he made a comparison of the early 1960s to the present day after a discussion on why the assassination of JFK is still relevant today. He called the Warren Commission the original fake news organization. The Warren Commission became the official narrative of the government. The commission had refused to look into information that was said to be exculpatory and which has been hidden in government secrecy. Schnapf said that he hopes this is going to come out this year to comply with the JFK Assassination Records Act.\n",
      " \n",
      "The group wants to use the shell casings that were found at the scene and ballistics analyses in the 21st century to find out if Oswald killed JFK or not. Schnapf said that the group would conduct a mock trial in November and then, later on, would go into a legal proceeding with the name of a Court of Inquiry, which would be a court proceeding that was official to prove that Oswald was not the one who shot Kennedy. They want to expunge the name of Oswald from the narrative and clear not only his name but that of his daughter. He concluded that “Oswald was not convictable, much less indictable”.\n",
      " \n",
      "The lawyers of the group have maintained that the mainstream media overlooked the real assassination story, the government is not transparent, and the Department of Justice has been politicized, including the FBI.\n",

Podcast makers are trying to create an entirely new form — one that needs to train kids and parents to follow entirely new family traditions. Sticking a kid in front of the morning cartoons may carry a whiff of stigma now, but it’s just as easy as it ever was. Also, it’s free. Partly because children’s podcast creators are claiming the moral high ground on screen time, advertising is controversial for the medium. Pinna is charging $7.99 a month for its ad-free offerings.

So in 2005, just as the podcast was emerging as a form, Mr. Bowers started his own homemade kids’ show with his 5-year-old daughter, Emma, taping episodes in a closet of their house.\n",
      "“Molly and the Sugar Monster” is a charming a bit of reverse psychology: It features Mr. Bowers as an ornery monster who urges kids to eat junk food, and Emma as a wily kid who taunts him with tales of her vegetable consumption until he explodes in frustration.\n",
      "Now the series has found a home on Pinna, where it’s been packaged along with a trove of exclusive audio content. Emma Bowers, now 17, collaborated with Mr. Bowers on an original “sound picture book” for the app, “Kid Wash,” which used a binaural recording system — a mold of a human head outfitted with microphones — to create a 3-D listening experience that feels unlike anything children can read or watch.\n",
      "In addition to snackable audio for younger children, Pinna offers longer, serialized narratives like “Remy’s Place,” an “Eloise”-style series about a boy who lives above a Brooklyn juke joint (created by “Blue’s Clues” composer Michael Rubin), and “Season Isle,” a fantasy series about twins living on an enchanted island. Pinna also snagged Gen-Z Media’s follow-up to “Mars Patel,” the paranormal mystery “The Ghost of Jessica Majors.”\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "Nonfiction content includes the kid’s trivia game show “ExtraBLURT,” the sports talk show “Good Sport!” and “The Show About Science.” Come November, Pinna will debut a choose-your-own-adventure podcast and, in December, a series styled like an advent calendar, with an episode dropping each day leading up to Christmas.\n",
      "Podcasts creators aren’t just selling content; they’re pitching a lifestyle shift. “Because kids weren’t valued as an audience in radio, I think there’s an assumption that kids don’t listen to audio, or they can’t stay engaged by it,” said Lindsay Patterson, co-chair of Kids Listen and the host of the children’s science podcast Tumble.\n",
      "Even NPR’s first podcast for kids, “Wow in the World,” was personally financed by its hosts, Mr. Raz and Mindy Thomas, who record the show on nights and weekends in Ms. Thomas’s basement studio in Fairfax, Va. (It’s paid off: Since its launch in May, “Wow and the World” has sat at the top of podcast rankings for kid and family content, racking up more than 3.6 million downloads.) “The Unexplainable Disappearance of Mars Patel,” which debuted last year, was the “Serial” of children’s podcasts and proved that serialized audio narratives could catch on among younger audiences.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "Podcast makers are hoping that as more and better content is made available, audio listening will become another family ritual, like reading books at bedtime or listening to kids’ albums in the car. One of Pinna’s marketing pitches is an attempt to establish new habits: “It’s for car time, play time, family time, chore time, bed time, any time.”\n",
      "But unlike with YouTube channels or mobile games, children don’t yet have an easy way to discover podcasts on their own. Even the “Kids & Family” section of iTunes is peppered with often-inappropriate content for couples and parents. Dedicated apps for children’s podcasts — in addition to Pinna, Kids Listen offers its own app for surfacing children’s content, as does a new app called Leela Kids — seeks to streamline that discovery process. “Four-year-olds, these days, will be very fluent in their use of the app,” Ms. Shapiro said.\n",
      "To help encourage the new habit, podcasters are leaning on some light shaming. As Matt Lieber, co-founder of the podcast company Gimlet Media, said at a panel on the state of podcasting last year, “The guilt of a parent who puts the television on to pacify their children is one of the most powerful emotional forces in existence.” (Gimlet, too, has a show for kids in the works.)\n",
      "Mr. Raz and Ms. Thomas have started their own company, Tinkercast, to expand their podcasting brand under the tagline: “Eyes Up. Screens Down. Jaws Dropped.” Panoply bills Pinna as “Screen free. Ad free. Guilt free.” It’s a tantalizing idea: a technological fix that feels like a throwback. “What we’re doing is not groundbreaking,” Mr. Raz said. “This is old-fashioned, old-school technology.”\n",
      "Partly because kids’ podcasts are trying to situate themselves as a more virtuous alternative to screen time, advertising to kids is a sticky issue. In the grown-up world, podcasters typically appeal to advertisers with boundless editorial flexibility; marketing pitches are often written, produced and performed by the hosts themselves.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "But research suggests that children respond to ads differently than adults do; they are less likely to differentiate between ads and other forms of entertainment, and they implicitly trust marketers’ claims. “You just can’t shove as much advertising into a kids’ show as you can into a show for adults,” said Ms. Patterson of Kids Listen. “Too many ads will turn parents off.”\n",
      "On “Wow in the World,” Mr. Raz and Ms. Thomas have opted to aim commercials at the parents who are listening in. Before a break, a child’s voice announces: “Grown-ups, this message is for you,” and then an adult voice-over artist reads ads for parent stuff like a meal-kit service or a sock start-up. Meanwhile, Panoply is hoping that parents will pay $7.99 a month for the ad-free Pinna. “I just think it’s coercive,” said Mr. Bowers of advertising to kids. To reach a broader audience, Pinna will also offer select episodes of its shows for free; those won’t have ads, either.\n",
      "If podcasters manage to capture the kids’ market, they stand to create podcast listeners for life. James Kee, the 7-year-old fan of “Wow in the World”, has already started branching out to more advanced fare. “I’ve listened to a little bit of ‘Pod Save America,’” he said.\n",

      "ZURICH (Reuters) - The possibility of a World Cup without Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi turned out to be a false alarm, yet next year’s tournament will still have a major absentee after the United States’ extraordinary failure to qualify on Tuesday.\n",
      "Panama, meanwhile, showed it is perfectly possible for small nations to qualify without expanding the finals to 48 teams, which is planned for the 2026 edition, as they joined Iceland in reaching the tournament for the first time.\n",
      "South American champions Chile, like African counterparts Cameroon, missed out on a ticket to Russia -- and, bizarrely, their elimination was the result of a successful protest made to FIFA about opponents fielding an ineligible player.\n",
      "Twenty-three of the 32 finalists have now been decided while the remainder will be settled in November with four European playoffs, two intercontinental playoffs and the final round of African qualifiers, where three groups are still open.\n",
      "Brazil, who will be making their 21st World Cup appearance, remain the only ever-present side at the finals and had qualified long before Tuesday’s drama.\n",
      "Ronaldo and Messi, who have won FIFA’s World Player of the Year award between them since 2008, went into the final group matches uncertain of whether they would take part next year.\n",
      "Those fears were allayed as Messi’s hat-trick led Argentina to a 3-1 win at high altitude in Ecuador to ensure their place and Portugal made it with a 2-0 win over Switzerland.\n",
      "The U.S., one of FIFA’s most important members in commercial terms, were not so lucky as a shock 2-1 defeat in Trinidad and Tobago, combined with wins for Panama and Honduras, ended their run of seven successive finals appearances.\n",
      "The Netherlands, semi-finalists in 2014 and runners-up in 2010, will also miss out while four-times champions Italy, who last failed to qualify in 1958, face a two-leg playoff in November.\n",
      "The impact of the U.S.’s absence will be felt at broadcasters Fox, who take over coverage of the World Cup from ESPN starting with the 2018 tournament and a host of sponsors, such as Nike, who had been hoping for plenty of World Cup exposure.\n",

      "SMALLER NATIONS\n",
      "Panama’s first-ever qualification for the finals prompted President Juan Carlos Varela to declare a national holiday, describing it on Twitter as an “historic day for the country”.\n",
      "But their 2-1 win over Costa Rica also highlighted global soccer body FIFA’s surprising decision not to use goal-line technology in the qualifiers, as the ball did not appear to fully cross the line for their first goal.\n",
      "Panama’s success also strengthened the hand of those who argue that the expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams is not necessary to allow more smaller countries to take part.\n",
      "Slideshow (3 Images)\n",
      "On Monday, Iceland, with a population of less than 350,000, became the smallest nation ever to qualify for the finals while Cape Verde, with a population of 550,000, are still in contention for one of the African places.\n",
      "A bigger World Cup may also devalue the qualifying competition, particularly in South America where two points separated five teams battling for two direct places and a playoff spot before Tuesday’s enthralling finale.\n",
      "An evening of unremitting tension ended with Uruguay, Argentina and Colombia joining Brazil in Russia, while Peru’s 1-1 draw was enough to land them in fifth place - the playoff spot - and continue dreaming of a first appearance since 1982.\n",
      "Peru sneaked ahead of Chile on goal difference after their southern neighbors lost 3-0 to Brazil and dropped to sixth. They were also indebted to Venezuela who stopped Paraguay from taking the playoff spot with a shock 1-0 win in Asuncion.\n",
      "Earlier in the competition, Chile got an extra two points after protesting that Bolivia fielded an ineligible player -- Paraguay-born Nelson Cabrera -- during a 0-0 draw in Santiago.\n",

      "A. The new “dock” in Apple’s latest version of its mobile software is similar to the tool bar that has been a part of its Mac operating system for years. Like the desktop version, the iOS 11 dock is designed to hide when you do not need it. The auto-hide behavior in macOS is optional and can be changed in the System Preferences, but the iOS 11 dock is designed to disappear to minimize screen clutter when you open an app on the iPad.\n",

      "THE News IS: Light’s memory is returning to him now. He recalls more and more details of his early life - about Kilgrave and his father. But there are some things he still doesn’t remember. Lana pushing him off the roof, for instance.\n",
      "One day Light is approached by a group of agents working for the CIA. (Sometimes they belong to another intelligence agency - it depends on what sort of mood Daya is in.) Where has he been, they ask? They’ve been looking for him ever since he was first kidnapped.\n",
      "Light tells them as much as he remembers. The agents are very impressed that Light is able to explain a case that has baffled them for years. So they ask him to join them and help solve crimes.\n",
      "But when he gets to their headquarters, he is stunned to see L working there too. Light is furious. Isn’t L part of the scorpion tattoo gang?\n",
      "L explains. He has come over to join the good guys. When Light left him, L was deeply upset and realised that he'd been going down the wrong path. He wanted to change. He’d been a bad guy until he met Light, and now he has decided to make amends.\n",
      "So Light and L are friends again. They join forces as partners solving crimes because they realise they need each other. L needs Light to accept his dark side, and Light needs L to help him relax and have fun.\n",
      "“Light’s wound up so tight he wants to control everything and be in charge all the time because he had no control for so long,” Daya says.\n",
      "They investigate the scorpion tattoo gang together, and they run into Lana, who still belongs to it. Lana becomes jealous of L because she can tell straight away there is something going on between him and Light. She tells Light he needs to take revenge on his father by killing him. But Light has other business to attend to first.\n",
      "Light tracks down Kilgrave and allows himself to be captured by him again. But once he is taken inside Kilgrave’s house and shackled to a wall, Light wraps his chains around Kilgrave’s neck and strangles him.\n",
      "Now that Light has killed her father, though, Lana swears vengeance against him.\n",
      "“She’s going to be the main villain for him now because she’s furious that he killed her dad,” Daya says.\n",

      "THE News IS: The league might find resistance from players for any new directive on the anthem, setting the course for more public tension.\n",
      "Martellus Bennett, a tight end for the Green Bay Packers, was quick to question the commissioner’s motives:\n",
      "Goodell’s letter was sent two days after the Dallas Cowboys’ owner Jerry Jones — a leader among owners, a supporter of the president and never one to bite his tongue — said in no uncertain terms that he would bench any players who “disrespect the flag.”\n",
      "“If we are disrespecting the flag, then we won’t play. Period,” Jones told The Dallas Morning News.\n",
      "On Twitter, the president congratulated Jones for his stance.\n",
      "Jones may be the most strident owner on this issue, but he is far from alone.\n",
      "The Miami Dolphins owner Stephen M. Ross, who had backed the players’ right to protest and even set up a nonprofit group last year to foster race relations, appears to be changing his stance. He told The Miami Herald that while many players insist their protests are about raising awareness of racial injustice, the president has “changed that whole paradigm of what protest is” by turning it into a statement on the flag and support of the military.\n",
      "Put another way, Ross is telling his players that they are hurting their cause by not standing for the anthem.\n",
      "This about-face should not be shocking.\n",
      "First and foremost, the owners, particularly those who have paid hundreds of millions of dollars for their teams, want to make money. From their point of view, anything that draws attention from the game, whether it is bullying in the locker room, domestic violence, or sitting or kneeling during the anthem, could put the television networks that broadcast the games and the league’s corporate sponsors in an awkward spot.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "“At this moment, Jerry Jones has made a business decision,” said Frank Zaccanelli, a former part owner of the Dallas Mavericks who knows Jones well. “He’s in Dallas, Texas, and owns America’s Team. If any business took a 10 to 12 percent business hit, red lights would be going off. If you’ve got 50 percent of your people against you, you are going to have drastic changes. If this continues down this road, you’ll see a deterioration that will be significant.”\n",
      "The owners, however, also want to avoid a showdown with the players’ union, and even some of their best players. After Jones threw down the gauntlet on Sunday, the N.F.L. Players Association issued a statement defending its members’ right to free expression.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "“We should not stifle these discussions and cannot allow our rights to become subservient to the very opinions our Constitution protects,” the union said.\n",
      "On Tuesday, Jones doubled down on his views during his radio show on KRLD-FM (105.3 The Fan). By threatening to bench players, Jones said his goal was to remove the Cowboys from the debate over whether players should or should not stand for the anthem.\n",
      "“I don’t want there to be any misunderstanding as to where I want the personnel of the Cowboys to be when we’re at the No. 1 workplace we have, which is the field and the sideline on game day,” Jones said. “I want to do everybody a service, as I should in leading the team, and let’s be really clear about what our expectations are.”\n",

      "The president’s tweets aside, the issue is in some ways taking care of itself. Hundreds of other players who protested two weeks ago, apparently more piqued at a president telling them what to do than the underlying causes the kneeling is supposed to highlight, are now back in line and standing for the anthem. Three players on the Dolphins who had knelt for the anthem in prior weeks chose on Sunday to stay in the locker room, which was also in defiance of league policy. They were not fined.\n",
      "That may not be enough for some owners, though, particularly when nearly two dozen players on the San Francisco 49ers continue to kneel during the anthem. It was the former quarterback of that team, Colin Kaepernick, who ignited the round of anthem demonstrations by kneeling during the anthem last season to draw attention, he said, to racial oppression and fatal shootings by the police of African-Americans.\n",
      "The 49ers’ chief executive officer, Jed York, has not only stood by his players, but also made a $1 million donation to the team’s community fund to highlight his support for Kaepernick.\n",
      "The controversy has spilled into the broader football community, with some former players lashing out at current players who refuse to stand for the anthem. Mike Ditka, a Hall of Fame player and head coach, said Monday that he did not believe that there had been any oppression in the United States in the last century. “All of a sudden, it’s become a big deal now, about oppression,” he said.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "Other former players, including wide receiver Steve Smith Sr., quickly reminded Ditka of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. “Great coach, clueless person,” Smith wrote on Twitter.\n",
      "The Cowboys and other N.F.L. teams, as private businesses, can limit what employees can say or do while working. To date, the league has not enforced its rule that players must be on the sideline for the anthem and should stand while it is being played, though the wording in the league manual does not make standing a requirement.\n",
      "The collective bargaining agreement, though, requires that these and other rules cannot be changed after the start of training camp.\n",
      "Joe Lockhart, a league spokesman, said no fines had been issued for players not on the sidelines but he declined to say if penalties, which could inflame tensions between players and owners and attract the kind of attention the league would rather not have, would be levied going forward.\n",
      "If the league suddenly began fining, benching or suspending players who do not stand for the anthem, it may prompt the union to file a lawsuit, said Michael LeRoy, who teaches sports law at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.\n",
      "“There’s a basic fairness issue when you change a rule during the season, especially when you are getting browbeaten by the president,” LeRoy said. “On paper, it’s not a change in the rule, but in reality it is.”\n",
      "Still, Lockhart, hinting at potential action by the owners, added,“Everyone here is frustrated by the process, and particularly the politics around this.”\n",
      "The owners, he said, would be meeting next week in New York and — no surprise — will be discussing what steps to take next, including, potentially, strengthening the language in its game operations manual.\n",
      "“There’s a strong feeling at every level,” Lockhart said, “that we ought to be getting back to football.”\n",

      "THE News IS: At the heart of “Turtles All the Way Down” is Aza Holmes, age 16, who suffers from terrible anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Her case sits on the icier, distant end of the spectrum. It is not easily managed.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "People tend to associate O.C.D. with repetitive behaviors, and that’s partly true in Aza’s case: She has a wound on her finger, self-inflicted, that she continually reopens in order to drain and re-sanitize.\n",
      "But her repetitive, intrusive thoughts are her true torment. She’s obsessed with — and repulsed by — the ecosystem of bacteria that seethes inside her, and the bacteria that live without. She can’t stop worrying about the rumble in her gut, or the breeding microbes therein, or the possibility of contracting an infection involving clostridium difficile, or the prospect of sweating, or not being able to stop sweating, or touching someone who is sweating. She has to fight off the insistent, unignorable urge to put hand sanitizer in her mouth. Sometimes the urge wins.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "We spend long stretches inside Aza’s head, listening to these swift and unsteady thoughts. The rational part of her, the one that sees a therapist and fitfully takes medication, tries to talk herself down. But her mind is in the throes of a civil war.\n",
      "“Please let me go,” Aza tells her unwanted thoughts at a particularly helpless moment. “I’ll do anything. I’ll stand down.”\n",
      "If Green were writing in his usual register, he’d interrupt Aza’s descents into these cognitive spirals — or “light-swallowing wormholes,” as she once calls them — with a bit of humor. But he seems to have made a decision: If Aza can’t find relief, neither can we.\n",

      "The first few chapters of “Turtles All the Way Down” are a little crude, a little awkward and a little slow to get off the ground — it’s as if Green needed extra time on the runway to overcome the weight of a success like “The Fault in Our Stars,” which became a touchstone for teenagers everywhere. (It has been rated 2,529,550 times on Goodreads, a number that continues to spin forward even as I type, like the odometer of a spaceship.) The premise: An Indianapolis billionaire has skipped town just before the police come to get him for bribery and fraud. A $100,000 reward is on offer to anyone who’s got the skinny on his whereabouts. Aza’s best friend, Daisy (the tornado), remembers that Aza knows this guy’s son. Wouldn’t he know something? And wouldn’t a hundred grand be grand?\n",
      "Aza does know his son. She’d met him years ago at “Sad Camp,” a summer program for kids who’d lost one or both of their parents. Aza had lost her father; Davis, the billionaire’s son, lost his mother. Now it seems that both of his parents are gone.\n",
      "So Aza reluctantly agrees to pay Davis a visit, and the novel — boom — begins in earnest. The two feel an ancient kinship, a bonding of broken souls. He’s terrified that his identity is inseparable from his money; she’s terrified that her identity is inseparable from her thoughts — aren’t people the sum of their thoughts? If they aren’t, what are they? “If you can’t pick what you do or think about,” she explains to him, “then maybe you aren’t really real, you know?”\n",
      "A sweet, conventional love story begins. But it hits a bittersweet, unconventional dead end. Aza can’t kiss Davis without panicking. All those microbes. “I’m not gonna un-have this,” she miserably explains of her condition.\n",
      "Still they bond. And Aza and Daisy try to solve the mystery of Davis’s father’s disappearance. At one point, Daisy gives Aza hell — doesn’t she see how her mental illness has made her self-absorbed? — and it’s awful. Then it isn’t. The friendships in Green’s novels are stirring and powerful. They’re one of the reasons we show up to read them.\n",
      "“You are my favorite person,” Daisy tells Aza after they’ve reconciled. “I want to be buried next to you. We’ll have a shared tombstone.”\n",
      "But the real question is: How does such a story end for Aza?\n",
      "If an author has integrity, it should end plausibly. Green has integrity. He also has O.C.D. He’s tweeted about it; he’s discussed it on his famous video blog with his brother, Hank. Watch his entry from July 25 sometime.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "I still wasn’t prepared for the ending of this novel. It’s so surprising and moving and true that I became completely unstrung, incapable of reading it to my husband without breaking down. One needn’t be suffering like Aza to identify with it. One need only be human. Everyone, at some point, knows what it’s like when the mind develops a mind of its own.\n",

      "THE News IS: ■ The Jets — yes, the Jets — have a winning record. Written off before the season after jettisoning several veterans and handing the offense over to the perennially disappointing Josh McCown, the Jets have ridden a weak schedule to a surprisingly impressive record. Wins over the Cleveland Browns, the Miami Dolphins and the wildly inconsistent Jaguars are not enough to convince anyone that the Jets are any sort of contender, but going into next week’s game against the New England Patriots, they are shockingly in a three-way tie with Buffalo and New England for the division lead in the A.F.C. East.\n",
      "■ The anthem issue has legs. The San Francisco 49ers had numerous players kneeling during the playing of the national anthem in Indianapolis, and it was more than Vice President Mike Pence could take, as he left the game tweeting about how he would not put up with such behavior. Teams had seemingly settled into their routines with the anthem, but with President Trump and Pence ramping things up, the demonstrations and protests could intensify. The vice president missed an exciting game between bad teams, with the Colts winning with a field goal in overtime.\n",
      "Here’s a look at all the action on the field and along the sidelines on Sunday:\n",

      "J.J. Watt is injured in Texans’ loss.\n",
      "J.J. Watt, a three-time defensive player of the year, suffered a tibial plateau fracture in the first quarter of the Houston Texans’ 42-34 loss to the undefeated Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. The injury, which affects the knee’s stability, will likely sideline Watt for the rest of the season.\n",
      "Watt appeared to be in tears as he was helped along the Houston Texans’ sideline after he collapsed on the field. On the play, Watt was charging at the quarterback and appeared to land awkwardly on his left foot before falling to his right knee. He was helped off the field, walking gingerly, with the crowd seemingly stunned by an injury to their team’s star.\n",
      "Houston’s defense, weakened by injuries to Watt and Whitney Mercilus, allowed a touchdown or field goal on each of Kansas City’s first five possessions, falling behind 23-7 at halftime. Deshaun Watson, the Texans’ exciting rookie quarterback, did his best to get his team back into the game, throwing five touchdown passes, but the Chiefs’ offense was able to grind things out by keeping Houston’s offense off the field for huge swaths of time.\n",
      "On Monday morning, Watt sent a message to Texans fans:\n",
      "The win came with serious injuries for Kansas City as well. Tight end Travis Kelce left with an apparent concussion and Chris Conley came out late in the game with an Achilles injury. But even with his offensive options limited, Alex Smith continued his unusual breakout season — which is coming in his 13th year. He completed 29 of 37 passes for 324 yards and three touchdowns. It was Smith’s second 300-yard passing game of the season, which is a career high.\n",
      "Kansas City will try to stretch their record to 6-0 next week when they host the Pittsburgh Steelers, while the Texans prepare to host the Cleveland Browns as they await further word on Watt’s status.\n",

      "Rodgers rips the Cowboys’ hearts out again.\n",
      "You can’t give Aaron Rodgers more than a minute.\n",
      "The Dallas Cowboys took a 3-point lead over the Green Bay Packers with a little more than a minute to play after a back-and-forth N.F.C. battle. That was plenty of time for Rodgers, who showed little interest in tying the game with a field goal, and instead engineered a lightning-fast 75-yard drive, winning the game with a 12-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams.\n",
      "In an on-field interview after the game, Adams seemed nonchalant about the latest heroic performance from his team’s quarterback, shrugging and saying “He just reminded us all we need is time and downs.”\n",
      "Rodgers had three touchdown passes, got some unexpected help from his team’s running game, and had his defense chip in a pick-six to improve Green Bay’s record to 4-1.\n",
      "Asked after the game about his ability to succeed at AT&T Stadium in Dallas, Rodgers, who was named the M.V.P. of Super Bowl XLV in the stadium, smiled and said, “They should have the Super Bowl here every year.”\n",
      "It was a quiet day in terms of yardage for Rodgers, who completed 19 of 29 passes for 221 yards, but he hit the passes he needed to and did not need to do all of the heavy lifting thanks to the emergence of Aaron Jones. In relief of the injured Ty Montgomery, Jones ran for 125 yards on 19 carries. His 7-yard touchdown near the end of the first half was the start of the Packers’ eventual comeback.\n",
      "Packers Coach Mike McCarthy was full of praise for Rodgers after the game.”I just don’t know what else to say about him,” McCarthy said. “I’ve got to expand my vocabulary.”\n",
      "That the Packers were in the game at all was surprising after Dak Prescott threw touchdown passes on each of his team’s first three drives. But for a second consecutive week, the Dallas offense stalled for much of the second half.\n",
      "Prescott threw three touchdowns and ran for another, but he was part of the problem thanks to a deflected pass that turned into a pick-six for Damarious Randall, who to that point had been a major liability in a game in which the Green Bay secondary lost Kevin King, one of its top performers, to a concussion.\n",

      "Seahawks get much-needed win over Rams.\n",
      "Russell Wilson passed for 198 yards and a touchdown, and Earl Thomas forced two of the Rams’ five turnovers in the Seattle Seahawks’ 16-10 victory over Los Angeles on Sunday.\n",
      "Jimmy Graham scored late in the first half in a defense-dominated win for the Seahawks (3-2), who shut out the NFL’s highest-scoring offense in the second half of their second straight win over their NFC West rivals. — Associated Press\n",

      "Odell Beckham Jr. could be out for season with broken ankle.\n",
      "The Giants dropped to 0-5 after losing 27-25 to the Los Angeles Chargers, but the bigger story of the game was Odell Beckham Jr., the team’s superstar wide receiver, fracturing his ankle in what could be a season-ending injury.\n",
      "The Giants were up 22-20 with four minutes left in the game when Beckham was brought down by Casey Hayward following an incomplete pass. Beckham’s left ankle turned badly under him, and he was on the ground for several minutes before being carted off the field. ESPN and other media outlets have reported that Beckham has a fractured fibula, and possible ligament damage, but the team thus far has not gone beyond the “fractured ankle” description.\n",
      "“You never want to see any receivers go down,” Manning said in a post-game news conference. “I told him I’d be thinking about him.”\n",
      "In a matchup between winless teams, the Giants’ receiving corps was decimated by injuries. Not only did Beckham leave in what could be a season-ending injury, but Dwayne Harris was forced out with a foot injury and Brandon Marshall left after coming down awkwardly on his heel in what could potentially be a season-ending Achilles tear. Sterling Shepard left the game with an ankle injury, meaning the team’s top four receivers are all currently injured.\n",
      "Beckham had five catches for 97 yards and a touchdown before the injury, but on the next play following his exit, Eli Manning lost a fumble and the Chargers were able to capitalize on the short field with Philip Rivers hitting Melvin Gordon for his third touchdown pass of the game. The Giants got one more chance to win, but Manning threw an interception, which sealed the team’s fate.\n",

      "After 49ers take a knee, Pence walks out of game.\n",
      "Vice President Pence began the day by tweeting a photo of himself at the game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers. Less than two hours later, Pence left the game because of a protest during the playing of the national anthem. President Trump later supported Pence’s decision, saying he had asked his vice president to leave if there were any protests.\n",
      "Mr. Pence’s first tweet was a photo of himself and his wife, with the vice president wearing a Colts hat and shirt, while his wife was wearing a Colts jersey. He said he was there to honor Peyton Manning, the longtime Colts quarterback who had a statue of himself unveiled in Indianapolis this weekend and was set to have his number retired into the team’s ring of honor at halftime.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "But just as they did last week, the 49ers had 20 or more players kneeling during the anthem in solidarity with their former teammate, Colin Kaepernick. The Colts had a demonstration of their own, with players wearing black t-shirts that said “We Will” on the front and “Stand for equality, justice, unity, respect, dialogue, opportunity” on the back.\n",
      "At 1:08 p.m. Eastern, just minutes after the anthem was played, Mr. Pence tweeted that he had left the game because of the demonstrations. He said he was unwilling to “dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem”.\n",
      "After several tweets explaining his reason for leaving, Mr. Pence tweeted a photo of himself and his wife standing during the anthem, with a member of the military next to them.\n",

      "Cam Newton shakes off the distractions to win.\n",
      "The question coming into the game was whether off-field distractions would affect Cam Newton, but the quarterback of the Carolina Panthers was at his best, leading his team to a 27-24 victory over the Detroit Lions.\n",
      "Newton, who lost a sponsorship this week over sexist remarks made to a female reporter, survived his team committing numerous sloppy penalties early in the game. He completed 26 of 33 passes for 355 yards and three touchdowns. It was the second consecutive game in which he had 300 passing yards and three touchdowns, and this week it was a result of his repeatedly taking advantage of Detroit’s inability to handle Ed Dickson. Asked to fill in for the injured Greg Olsen, Dickson, a tight end, caught five passes for 175 yards, repeatedly extending drives that appeared on the verge of stalling out.\n",

      "Jaguars pick apart Roethlisberger and the Steelers.\n",
      "The Jacksonville Jaguars are a team of many flaws, but when it comes to pass defense they are among the best in the game. The Pittsburgh Steelers found that out the hard way, losing at home to Jacksonville, 30-9.\n",
      "Ben Roethlisberger, who publicly quarreled with his receiver Antonio Brown this week, had one of the worst games of his career, throwing a career-high five interceptions while completing 33 of 55 passes for 312 yards.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "Two of Roethlisberger’s interceptions were returned for touchdowns, and Jacksonville’s other touchdowns came as a result of short fields following Roethlisberger interceptions, meaning the Pittsburgh turnovers led to 27 of the Jaguars’ 30 points.\n",
      "The game showed off the best aspects of Jacksonville’s defense, as the team moved to 3-2. Jalen Ramsey broke up several big plays to go along with his interception, Tashaun Gipson intercepted two passes in the second half, while Barry Church returned his pick for a touchdown. The team also got a pick-six from Telvin Smith, a starting linebacker.\n",
      "The Jaguars defense was not all interceptions, however, as they tightened things up considerably when Pittsburgh got the ball into the red zone, with the Steelers not scoring on any of their three drives that got inside the 20-yard line.\n",
      "The lack of offense by the Steelers was exacerbated by a great game from Leonard Fournette, the rookie running back who had 181 rushing yards and two touchdowns, including a 90-yard score in the fourth quarter. He has now scored touchdowns in four of his first five career games.\n",
      "Despite recent tension between them, Brown defended his team’s quarterback following the disastrous performance, saying the Steelers do not point the finger, but point the thumb at themselves when they fail.“He’s our general,” Brown said of Roethlisberger. “We rally around him, the good and the bad. We know there’s going to be more good.”\n",
      "Thanks to Roethlisberger’s interceptions, no offense was necessary.\n",
      "Here’s what teams did during the national anthem on Sunday.\n",
      "San Francisco 49ers: More than 20 Niners knelt during the anthem, with several of their teammates standing behind them. Vice President Pence walked out of the game shortly after the anthem, stating on Twitter that he would “not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.”\n",
      "Indianapolis Colts: The Colts wore black t-shirts with the words “We Will” on the front and “Stand for equality, justice, unity, respect, dialogue, opportunity” on the back for the second straight week. During the anthem, the players stood with their arms locked.\n",

      "Philadelphia Eagles: Malcolm Jenkins, with teammate Chris Long’s arm around his shoulder, raised his first above his head during the anthem before the game against the Cardinals. Rodney McLeod joined him by raising a fist.\n",
      "N.Y. Giants: Injured defensive end Olivier Vernon knelt during the anthem before the game against the Chargers, as he has done in previous weeks. Linebacker Keenan Robinson raised his fist in the air, while the rest of the Giants locked arms.\n",
      "Around the N.F.L.: Jets win again; Browns still winless.\n",
      "Josh McCown came back to Cleveland and beat the team that cut him, throwing two touchdown passes and leading the surprising New York Jets to a 17-14 win over the winless Browns, who benched rookie quarterback DeShone Kizer and fell to 1-20 under coach Hue Jackson.\n",
      "McCown threw a 2-yard TD pass to Austin Seferian-Jenkins in the third quarter and a 24-yarder to Jermaine Kearse in the fourth to give the Jets (3-2) a 17-7 lead en route to their third straight victory.\n",
      "■ The Indianapolis Colts scrapped the Peyton Manning playbook Sunday. Instead, they relied on ball control and patience.\n",
      "After blowing a 14-point lead in the final eight minutes or regulation and surviving an interception in scoring position in overtime, Marlon Mack’s 35-yard run set up Adam Vinatieri for a 51-yard field goal that beat San Francisco 26-23. — Associated Press\n",

      "THE News IS: (Reuters) - Olivier Giroud’s scorpion kick strike for Arsenal against Crystal Palace last season was shortlisted for FIFA’s goal of the year award on Monday, alongside efforts from Venezuelan teenager Deyna Castellanos and goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke.\n",
      "Giroud scored with an improvised volley in the Premier League match on Jan. 1, producing an acrobatic flick with his left heel to convert Alexis Sanchez’s cross into the net off the crossbar while tumbling forward.\n",
      "Arsenal won the match 2-0 and Giroud, who admitted afterwards that he had a bit of luck with his connection, said it was the best goal he had ever scored.\n",
      "The 31-year-old is the seventh Frenchman to be nominated for the award but the first to make the final shortlist of three, world soccer’s governing body said on its website. (www.fifa.com)\n",
      "Castellanos is the second Venezuelan woman in successive years to make the final three and was nominated for her strike from the halfway line against Cameroon at the U-17 Women’s World Cup in Jordan last year.\n",
      "The 18-year-old follows in the footsteps of compatriot Daniuska Rodriguez, whose goal made the final three for last year’s award but lost out to Malaysian Mohd Faiz Subri’s spectacular 35-metre, swerving free-kick.\n",
      "South Africa’s Masuluke is the first goalkeeper as well as the first player from Africa to make it to the final three for his last minute bicycle-kick equalizer for Baroka FC against Orlando Pirates last year.\n",
      "The winner of the award, named after the late Hungary captain Ferenc Puskas, will be decided by the public and announced at FIFA’s annual player of the year ceremony in London on Oct. 23.\n",

      "BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Communist Party opened a meeting on Wednesday to make final preparations for a key party congress later this month, state media said, a five-yearly event where President Xi Jinping is expected to further tighten his grip on power.\n",
      "The seventh plenary session of the party’s Central Committee will review draft reports on the work of the party, its discipline and anti-corruption commission, and amendments to be made to the party’s constitution, all of which will be delivered at the 19th Party Congress that opens on Oct. 18, the official Xinhua news agency said.\n",
      "The congress will “summarize historical progress and precious experiences” in advancing socialism with Chinese characteristics gained with Xi at the party’s core, Xinhua said.\n",
      "“The congress will also thoroughly examine the current international and domestic situation and draw out guidelines and policies that respond to the call of the times,” the news agency said, without giving specifics.\n",
      "Details of the speech that Xi, the party’s general secretary, will give at the opening session of the congress are closely guarded secrets, although the event is more about ideology than concrete policies.\n",
      "It is unclear how long the plenum will last, but it could be just a single day. It will end with a long communique, issued by Xinhua, that is usually full of party phraseology but could be short on specifics.\n",
      "Last October, the party gave Xi the title of “core” leader, a significant strengthening of his position ahead of the congress, at which a new Standing Committee, the pinnacle of power in China, will be constituted.\n",
      "The party’s constitution will be amended at the end of the congress, likely to include a reference to Xi’s thinking or ideology as a guiding party principle.\n",
      "Mao Zedong and the reformist former leader Deng Xiaoping already have their names enshrined in the document, although Xi’s two immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, do not.\n",

      "“We’re changing up the point of entry,” Mr. Schwartz said. “If you were a fan of the original, it honors the spirit of that. And then those new to the show should be ready for a fun, twisted serial.”\n",
      "“Downton Abbey” and “Billions” have showed that viewers still enjoy the foibles of the rich. But reboots have become iffy propositions, with originals readily available on Amazon Prime and in DVD box sets. The revival of “Dallas,” on TNT, was canceled after three seasons in 2014, even with the draw of original cast members. “Dynasty” has none thus far (one, Gordon Thomson, called the new show “an abomination” in an interview with The Daily Beast). Some fans, however, have hopefully proposed Heather Locklear, the original Sammy Jo and another “Melrose” veteran, to play Alexis, Cristal’s archrival.\n",
      "But she was nowhere in evidence here this summer on a cavernous soundstage, which was home to an update of the Carrington mansion, where this reporter spent many happy escapist hours as a pre-teen, learning nothing less than how to be a woman.\n",
      "“Lip-plumping treatments,” Mr. Show, compactly handsome at 55, was muttering in between takes, rolling the phrase around in his mouth like one of the top-shelf brandies Mr. Forsythe’s Blake Carrington favored. “Lip-plumping treatments.”\n",
      "Blake had just delivered to his headstrong daughter, Fallon (Elizabeth Gillies), the bad news that their family name had been trademarked by her mother, his ex-wife Alexis, for a cosmetics line.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "The “Dynasty” name was also tarnished by the time Mr. Show met Mr. Spelling, whose Holmby Hills, Calif., mansion seemed a version of Blake Carrington’s, on “Melrose.” He remembered the older man as strict and stingy, using so-called honey wagons to remove sewage rather than install proper plumbing, but also possessing a certain thespian gravitas.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "“Aaron used to say, putting his hands up and framing your face in a very square, ‘just your face’ way, ‘My shows are all about character,’” Mr. Show said during a break in taping, sitting at a dining table surrounded by expensive art. “He filmed straight-on, close to camera. You could tell an Aaron show in less than a second.”\n",
      "The new “Dynasty,” in contrast, has Ms. Savage and Mr Schwartz’s own distinct aesthetic. Scenes are shorter: three or four minutes as opposed to six or seven. Skirts are also shorter. Music is louder. Lighting is dimmer. Slo-mo is occasionally deployed. And knowing references are rife, including to Trumps, Kardashians and Murdochs.\n",
      "That the White House currently contains a real-estate tycoon— familiar from the ’80s, yet — and his scions makes “Dynasty” seem particularly resonant, though of course tangling bloodlines are a dramatic device as old as the ancient Greeks. “From the Clintons to the Kennedys, this isn’t a new thing, our fascination with these really powerful families,” said Nathalie Kelley, who plays Cristal. “But one thing we’ve talked about which is interesting is patriarchy — how much it has shifted, and how much it’s stayed the same.”\n",
      "The former Krystle (Linda Evans) had been Blake’s secretary, positioned in perpetual saintly opposition to the devious Alexis and meekly tiptoeing around the Carrington mansion like the nameless heroine of Daphne du Maurier’s “Rebecca.”\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "“In the original Blake is shutting the door in her face because she has to have a meeting and she’s trying to get a word in about the china or something,” Ms. Kelley said. “She’s not really given much to do besides be beautiful and look after the house.”\n",
      "This Cristal begins in public relations and goes on to contest fiercely with Fallon to become chief operating officer of the Carrington energy company.\n",
      "She is also young enough to be his daughter, though Ms. Kelley argued that at 33 she is past an age that could provoke eye rolls. “When I first met with Josh and Stephanie, I was like, ‘I think Cristal needs to be at least in her 30s,’” she said. “I don’t think women around the world are going to be happy with this rich billionaire in his 50s dating someone who’s under 30, and that threshold makes a big difference.”\n",
      "As Mr. Show put it: “People are younger today. The whole show’s younger.”\n",
      "Indeed if any demographic is neglected in the new version, it is the Modern Maturity set. Ms. Collins was 48 when she first swept into the courtroom when Blake was being tried for the murder of his son Steven’s male lover; Mr. Forsythe was 63. Later additions from the golden age of Hollywood, Diahann Carroll and Rock Hudson, were in their 50s — the latter’s death of AIDS in 1985 provoking a national conversation about whether he’d jeopardized Ms. Evans’s health with their onscreen kiss.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "As the cast awaits its Alexis, conflict has been heightened between Cristal and Fallon: a role played first by Pamela Sue Martin, then known for “Nancy Drew” and “The Poseidon Adventure,” and subsequently by the British actress Emma Samms, in one of those switcheroos that soap viewers are supposed to accept unblinkingly but now discuss for years afterward in searchable online forums. (A casting change for Steven was attributed to plastic surgery following an explosive accident on an oil rig, but producers decided simply to ignore Fallon’s change in appearance.)\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "As embodied by Ms. Gillies, Fallon has been upgraded from a somewhat lost soul, climbing in and out of beds and winsomely up trees — and later, on a spin-off called “The Colbys,” being abducted by aliens — to an ambitious businesswoman, still sleeping with the chauffeur but now also leaning in with a steely glare.\n",
      "Ms. Gillies, 24, said she had admired Ms. Collins since seeing her in “The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas” as a child and now regularly retweets the older woman’s Throwback Thursday hashtags to her own 4.6 million followers (thanks mainly to her role on “Victorious”). “I’m not playing Alexis but Fallon has inherited a lot of her gusto,” Ms. Gillies said. “She’s less passive than at least Pamela Sue Martin was — she had a relaxed nature. I wouldn’t say that my Fallon is as relaxed, for better or for worse. I think she’s got a lot more bite.”\n",
      "She is also entwined enough with Blake that some early viewers have suggested her character resembles Ivanka Trump, and for them Ms. Gillies has developed a one-line rejoinder: “I have better shoes,” she said, striding away in a pair of Christian Louboutin heels.\n",
      "Neither iteration of “Dynasty” can be separated from its devotion to materialism and the one percent. “I just have memories of how white the rooms were, the carpet — that’s what the rich have,” said Ms. Patrick, the showrunner, who grew up in Atlanta.\n",
      "But the very rich are not only different from you and me, but from how they used to be. The 2017 Colbys made their money in tech, the Carrington children are concerned about the environment and everyone accepts differences in race and sexual orientation unblinkingly. The once dithering Steven is now “gay and proud,” Ms. Patrick said. “That’s not his issue with his father; it’s that he’s a liberal.”\n",
      "Mr. Show said he thought “this Blake has a lot more pathology” than his predecessor. Crew members were hammering behind him at the opulent set, with its staircase built for flouncing down O‘Hara-style, and twinkling chandeliers.\n",
      "“He tells untruths when he doesn’t need to and I don’t know why yet, I’m developing the character,” Mr. Show said. “I’m taking that as seriously as I possibly can, and then it cuts to a catfight.”\n",

      "THE News IS: Maddon is well-known for trying to keep things light — on Sunday, for instance, he put a buffet on the field at Wrigley as his players practiced — but he is also wholeheartedly behind the friendship circles that were created by Buss.\n",
      "“He’s so creative,’’ Maddon said. “What he does in the weight room and what he does by having the masses outside, it’s very entertaining and the guys look forward to it. They really do.’’\n",

      "Buss, who has been the team’s strength and conditioning coordinator since 2001, began the group sessions on the field in August of 2016. The Cubs had the best record in baseball at the time, but Buss said a member of the club was having a tough time. So he gathered his colleagues around him on the field and asked everyone to say something positive.\n",

      "So it began, and the daily gatherings have continued ever since.\n",
      "The group sessions on the field are not long — anywhere from five to 10 minutes — but they are full of life and laughter. After each of his teammates spoke in the circle the other day, La Stella offered a hug. First baseman Anthony Rizzo had his arms wrapped around two teammates during Saturday’s gathering. And that day, as Tekchandani entered the circle, he was welcomed with a round of applause.\n",
      "“It helps a lot,” catcher Willson Contreras said of the bonding. “It keep us together as a family, and happy together, despite being in a pressure-filled situation in the playoffs.”\n",
      "“It’s like 10 minutes of fun,” Buss said.\n",
      "Buss, who sports a beer belly and a mohawk, is immensely popular among Cubs players. In spring training, he is famous for the outrageous outfits he wears as he presides over daily conditioning. But there seems to be a method to his madness.\n",
      "“Even though he’s funny and comes off as a goofball, he’s one of the smartest guys we’ve got in here,” outfielder Albert Almora Jr. said. “If he’s doing something, it’s for a purpose.”\n",
      "Buss is modest about what impact his feel-good exercises may be having on the team’s fortunes. Feeling good does not guarantee a player will whack a really good curveball for a hit. “I don’t know how much that plays into it,’’ he said of the connection between what he does on the field with the players and what they do when the game begins.\n",
      "But the players — Buss’s players really — beg to differ. “The more positive things in the clubhouse, the better the results,” Contreras said.\n",
      "Bryant noted that even though the pregame sessions are a daily phenomenon, those taking part do not run out of things to mention. It is easy, he said, to always find something nice to say about the person standing in the middle of the circle, whether it be about their role as a teammate or friend or co-worker or parent.\n",
      "“It definitely gets everyone’s confidence up,’’ Russell said. “To hear nice things said about you from guys that are professionals and have been for a long time, it definitely makes you happy.”\n",

      "THE News IS: What is your first significant basketball memory?\n",
      "The very first one I had was in San Antonio. This was when the Spurs were really bad and they were straight up giving tickets away for like a dollar or two. My dad works at Via, which is the metro bus system in San Antonio. He would get tickets through his work, so he would take me to games every so often. That’s the first thing I remember about basketball, going to those games with him when I was 6 or 7.\n",

      "In “The Rap Year Book,” you ranked the most important rap songs for each year from 1979 to 2014. In rap, there are albums that you might love because they are technically good, and there are others you love because they’re connected to specific memories. Does that work the same way for you with basketball players?\n",
      "Absolutely. There’s a chapter in the book called “Who Is Your Memory Hero?” It’s about that exact thing. Like, who is a player that you remember when you were a kid and were like, “This is the best basketball player in the world,” and when you got older you realized that person was actually not that good? For me, it was this guy who played on the Spurs named Vinny Del Negro. For some reason he was just a lovable guy. Part of it was there was a rumor going around that he was actually Mexican, so me and my friends were like, “He is the M.V.P. of the league because of that.” I got older and looked him up, he bounced in and out of the league, he was never an All-Star, wasn’t that great, but I’ll love him forever. In that chapter, I had some other basketball writers write about people they thought about in that same sort of way. That’s probably one of my favorite chapters, too.\n",
      "If you were to betray the Spurs and take on a new favorite team, what team would it be?\n",
      "This year it would be the Oklahoma City Thunder. It changes based on the year. This year they have Russell Westbrook, he’s a very intense point guard for them. They became one of my favorite teams last year because Kevin Durant, who was his main partner, left for a better team. I’m drawn to the teams that I know aren’t going to win a championship but are still going to fight for it. And that’s very much what the Thunder are right now.\n",

      "Do you have any basketball memorabilia with sentimental value? What’s the story behind it?\n",
      "I have a basketball signed by David Robinson, who was one of the greatest Spurs of all time. He came to Sam Houston State when I was there. I had never met him before, and I got a phone call one day from a buddy of mine, and he was telling me, “David Robinson is here and he’s giving a talk.” I went to go try to get in, but it was already full. I saw the high school basketball team hanging around, so I assumed their coach had set up a meet and greet with David, so I just hung out with them. The coach noticed me and told me I had to leave, so I was bummed out. As I’m walking down the hall, David Robinson came out of one of the rooms. In my head I thought I was going to have all this charming stuff to say to him and we were going to become friends. I panicked. I didn’t say any words at all. I just handed him the ball and the marker and mumbled my name. He wrote a Bible passage on it; he’s very religious. He gave it to me, and I just walked off.\n",

      "THE News IS: FILE PHOTO: A reporter raises his hand to ask a question during a news conference by Bain Capital LP Managing Director Yuji Sugimoto (not in the picture) in Tokyo, Japan October 5, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Kyung/File Photo\n",
      "HONG KONG/TOKYO (Reuters) - Bain Capital is planning on further ramping up its dealmaking in Japan after it came out on top in the recent battle to purchase Toshiba’s semiconductors arm and as it bids to buy out Japan’s third-largest advertising agency, Asatsu-DK (ADK).\n",
      "In making further acquisitions, the Boston-based Bain would cement its position as one of the most active private equity firms in Japan and help to break down a corporate culture that has been mostly hostile to foreign investors.\n",
      "“Japan is a hard market. It takes years to build teams, relationships, credibility,” said David Gross-Loh, who is Bain’s co-head of Asia and is in charge of its business in Japan, in an interview. “I wouldn’t be surprised that five years from now we’ll have twice as many deals as we do now.”\n",
      "Japan’s private equity market is small relative to its economy, the world’s third largest. This year, though, the Toshiba acquisition has pushed private equity-backed deals in Japan to a record $22 billion - more than double 2016’s $8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n",
      "From 2007 to 2016, some 30-40 buyout deals on average were struck annually with slightly fewer exits each year, according to data provider Preqin. And both deals and exits have been worth a fraction of those done in China every year.\n",
      "Yet this year has seen a pick up in interest, industry sources say, in part thanks to significant volumes of cash raised in 2016 as funds look to Japan. They are hoping to cash in on demographic shifts -- such as the nation’s aging population - changes in corporate governance standards and a more active initial public offering market allowing for future exits.\n",
      "Bain led a group of investors, including Apple, SK Hynix , Dell, Seagate Technology Plc and Kingston Technology that agreed to pay $18 billion for the Toshiba chips business after a mammoth bidding battle.\n",
      "FORGING TIES\n",
      "Bain is one of several global private equity firms that opened offices in Japan before the global financial crisis, but it has bet on its own team to forge relationships, rather than rely on banks or advisers - a slower process.\n",
      "And American rivals have also piled in. KKR & Co is looking to deploy more money in Japan after completing a string of investments, while Carlyle Group targets companies in the upper-mid size with its Japan fund, while seeking larger deals with its funds in other global regions.\n",
      "Another global name, Blackstone Group, will remain focused on real estate in Japan, a person familiar with the firm said.\n",
      "But Bain has been ahead, striking two of Japan’s five largest private equity-backed M&A deals, with Toshiba the biggest. KKR’s $4.2 billion acquisition of auto parts maker Calsonic Kansei Corp is the second largest.\n",
      "Gross-Loh said that Bain is able to catalyze growth at Japanese domestic businesses that were stable and well-managed but weren’t exposed to global rivals and therefore not as competitive as they could be.\n",
      "Both Bain and Carlyle last year participated in the high-profile auction of Takata Corp, which filed for bankruptcy in June after its air bags were linked to deaths and injuries.\n",
      "According to people familiar with the deal, Bain is part of the winning bid for Takata, led by Chinese-owned U.S.-based Key Safety Systems. Bain declined to comment on Takata.\n",
      "BIG IN JAPAN\n",
      "In a decade, Bain has invested in a wide range of companies in Japan, from hot spring chains, wind farms to a mushroom growing business. Bain invests in Japan out of its Asian funds and sometimes use dry powder from its global funds for larger transactions - such as the Toshiba deal.\n",
      "One of its most lucrative deals in Japan was a $67 million investment in Domino’s Pizza Japan in 2010, which as of May this year generated an internal rate of return of 156 percent, according to data from Centre for Asia Private Equity Research.\n",
      "Bain has been patient.\n",
      "It started talking to the corporate level of Toshiba about seven years ago, while discussions around their semiconductor business started more than two years ago - long before the crisis that prompted the nuclear-to-laptops group to sell out.\n",
      "It separately spent three years building the relationship with ADK, one of the only three advertising agencies in the country that has access to Japan’s dominating TV networks.\n",
      "But it is not guaranteed success every time.\n",
      "Both Toshiba and ADK deals are yet to be completed, and Bain’s buyout offer for ADK has been opposed by the agency’s largest sharehoders.\n",
      "“As global funds like KKR and Bain are getting bigger, they can allocate more cash to Japan,” said Sam Takata, head of private equity investment at Tokio Marine Asset Management.\n",

      "THE News IS: Cedric L. Alexander is a CNN law enforcement analyst and deputy mayor of Rochester, New York. The views expressed here are solely those of the author.\n",
      "(CNN) At least 58 people were killed and over 500 injured when 64-year-old Stephen Paddock opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas. The crime instantly entered the record books as the worst mass shooting in modern American history.\n",
      "The thing is -- it could have been worse.\n",
      "I know that sounds lame. But I have been in law enforcement for more than 40 years, and I am no Pollyanna. It could have been worse is a simple statement of fact. If the police had gone after him with anything less than military-grade equipment, weapons, and training, there is no doubt it all would have been far worse.\n",
      "As far as we know at present, Paddock had an arsenal of firearms in his room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, some of which he used against concertgoers penned into an open-air venue 32 stories beneath his windows. Among the weapons were .223 caliber and .308 caliber rifles equipped with telescopic sights, at least one of which had been altered to function in fully automatic mode.\n",
      "Paddock had a mountain of ammunition with him, thousands of rounds. And, ensconced within a locked room in a jam-packed hotel, shooting down at a crowd from very high up, he was virtually unassailable — at least for a span of many, many lethal minutes.\n",
      "Paddock was an accountant by trade and a gambler by avocation, a man with no known military experience. Nevertheless, he had both armed and positioned himself like a modern military sniper. The weapons and ammunition were, for all intents and purposes, military grade . The tactics were military-equivalent -- he broke out two windows to achieve two tactical angles of fire.\n",
      "Facing a perpetrator like Paddock, police need more than courage, integrity, and skill. They also need the kind of equipment the Las Vegas officers had at hand on Sunday. There, officers had assault rifles ready in their cruisers. The department had the MRAP -- Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected -- military vehicles essential to transporting officers, under fire, right up to where the threat was. The rifles and vehicles are standard issue to Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) officers.\n",
      "Most important of all, the Las Vegas department had the SWAT officers themselves with the training to use their lethal equipment, and they had policies in place to ensure that this equipment was used to save lives, not to intimidate the community.\n",
      "One of the most commonly and sincerely expressed concerns I hear from communities -- and have heard them for a long time as a law enforcement executive and now as a deputy mayor — is about the \" militarization \" of police. People really do want the police to \"serve and protect\" them. They want the police to partner with the community to make everyone safer. They want to feel that the police are allies and guardians in the neighborhood, not a hostile army of occupation.\n",
      "In a constitutional democracy, these are the right feelings to have.\n",
      "In 1997, the National Defense Authorization Act created the 1033 Program , which allowed the Defense Department to transfer excess military equipment to police forces that requested it. Much equipment was acquired this way -- everything from cold-weather clothing to flashlights to ammunition, but also major military hardware, including grenade launchers, aircraft, and armored vehicles.\n",
      "When such tactical equipment is doled out to departments whose leaders have not formulated policies for its use and whose personnel are not trained to use it, all you get is a militarized police force that looks like it's at war with the community.\n",
      "In my law enforcement career, nothing gives me more pride than having taken part in the early evolution of community policing back in the 1980s. As a champion of community policing, I have expressed my concern when SWAT teams and 1033 equipment is misused. When I was called in to consult on the unrest that followed the August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, I was then and am still convinced that the indiscriminate use of military-style vehicles, military-looking assault weapons, and BDU (Battle Dress Uniform) gear transforms a community's perception of the police from partners in safety to hostile invaders.\n",
      "But then there are the worst-case scenarios. Terrorist attacks, mass shootings, hostage taking, violent bank robberies -- these are crimes in which perpetrators are typically heavily armed, often tactically armed. Whatever else the police are sworn to do, they are sworn to respond to these worst-case scenarios intelligently, bravely, and selflessly. In Rochester, New York, where I am deputy mayor and former police chief, we are made safer by the presence of a great SWAT team, which has some of the best operators I've seen in my visits to many police departments across this country.\n",
      "Most police officers take pride in the job they do. They take pride in using the right tools and tactics for the application, situation, or mission at hand. They don't put on riot gear to make a traffic stop. They don't roll up in an MRAP when people are peacefully protesting.\n",
      "As it happened, Stephen Paddock took his own life before the SWAT team breached the door to his room. I imagine he killed himself because he knew he could not prevail against a \"militarized\" police force.\n",
      "I know that the Las Vegas community is thankful it has such a police force, because the worst-case scenario is not the daily case but it is the daily possibility. These are the times in which we live.\n",
      "Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n",
      "Odds are, the Las Vegas shooting's record-setting status will not prove permanent. Twenty-seven were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012, 49 killed in an Orlando, Florida, nightclub in 2016, and at least 58 killed in Las Vegas.\n",
      "Mass murder on a military scale does not happen every day in America. But as we've seen, it may occur any day. Accordingly, we need police departments with agile, proactive, and courageous tactical policies.\n",
      "We need appropriately trained and equipped police officers who can respond on a military scale when necessary. We need police and civil leaders who have the knowledge, intelligence, empathy, courage, and imagination to decide when such a response is necessary to save lives.\n",
      "For all their unspeakable grief and pain, the people of Las Vegas now know their community has such leaders and such police officers looking out for them.\n",

      "THE News IS: LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Marvel’s big green Hulk may not be getting his own standalone movie but actor Mark Ruffalo, who plays the current iteration of the superhero, said the character will get a mini arc within three upcoming Marvel movies.\n",
      "Hulk, the muscle-bound, larger-than-life green alter-ego of scientist Bruce Banner, appears in the upcoming “Thor: Ragnarok,” out in U.S. theaters on Nov. 3, as a gladiator trapped on a futuristic planet and forced to fight Thor.\n",
      "The Hulk will also appear in 2018’s “Avengers: Infinity War” and its sequel, 2019’s yet-to-be-titled Avengers 4.\n",
      "“We’ve taken the arc of a standalone Hulk movie and put it into those three movies, consciously,” Ruffalo said.\n",

      "Ruffalo, who has spent more time as scientist Banner than as the Hulk in the past two Avengers films, said he relished the opportunity to be in character as the Hulk for the majority of “Thor: Ragnarok.”\n",
      "“This movie is about just breaking free of the forms and rules, and so I got to break free from what we thought Hulk was to a slightly more fleshed-out character,” he said.\n",
      "Slideshow (11 Images)\n",
      "The Hulk, who first appeared in comics in 1962, has had his own standalone television shows and movies in the past, notably 2003’s “Hulk” and 2008’s “The Incredible Hulk” films, both from Universal Pictures.\n",

      "THE News IS: LONDON (Reuters) - The saga of two families pitted against a barbaric social hierarchy in the Mississippi Delta after World War Two explores a racial divide that is relevant even today, the filmmaker of new movie “Mudbound” said.\n",
      "“I feel like ‘Mudbound’ kind of comments on who we are now,” director and co-writer Dee Rees told Reuters at the “Mudbound” premiere in London on Thursday.\n",
      "“It’s about family, it’s about what it means to not be able to come home, it’s about citizenship, who’s an American, who’s not and so like those things would be, like timeless,” she added.\n",
      "“Mudbound,” based on Hillary Jordan’s novel of the same name, stars Jason Mitchell, Garrett Hedlund, Carey Mulligan and Jason Clarke and follows the struggles of two farming families - one black, one white - in the heart of the American South in the 1940s.\n",
      "“Mudbound,” which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival for independent movies, is already garnering strong reviews and Oscar buzz, and will debut on Netflix on Nov. 17.\n",
      "The film explores the friendship of two men, one from each family, as they return from war and find common ground while their families face an unending struggle for and against the unforgiving land.\n",
      "“What this film does so cleverly is it creates empathy,” Mulligan said.\n",
      "“It gets you in the mind of all the different characters. It makes you look at so many people’s different perspectives and it asks you to ask the right questions, but it’s not prescriptive. It’s not telling you what to think.”\n",

      "THE News IS: Among the surprising statistics in Hunt’s breakout season is the amount of space he creates before he is touched. He has averaged 4.15 yards before contact, according to Sportradar, which not only makes him first in the N.F.L., but the figure is also more than double the leaguewide average (1.94) over the last three seasons. His average has been aided tremendously by 69- and 58-yard touchdown runs in which he was not touched, but he has exceeded the league average in that statistic on 34 of his 68 carries, with 14 runs in which he went 6 or more yards before contact. And he has done most of that behind a banged-up offensive line playing without its starting center, Mitch Morse.\n",
      "Houston tends to surprise in big moments, and Hunt is bound to cool off at some point. But, at least this week, the only undefeated team left in the N.F.L. is likely to stay that way.\n",
      "Pick: Chiefs\n",
      "Panthers at Lions 1 p.m., Fox\n",
      "Line: Lions by 2 ½\n",
      "Cam Newton should have spent the week talking about how he and the Panthers (3-1) had their way with the New England Patriots in Week 4, but his decision to mock a female reporter at a news conference created yet another distraction for the player and the team. How the emotional Newton will react to this self-imposed turmoil is unknown, but the situation came just as he finally looked healthy, throwing and running with confidence against New England.\n",
      "The Lions (3-1) should pose an interesting test. They can put up points in a hurry, but can also frustrate opposing quarterbacks. Detroit’s lone loss came in a nail-biter against the Atlanta Falcons, with the team falling inches short of victory on a catch in the closing seconds. The talent is there for both teams to shine, but with the game in Detroit, the edge goes to the Lions. Pick: Lions\n",
      "Packers at Cowboys 4:25 p.m., Fox\n",
      "Line: Cowboys by 2\n",
      "The revamped Green Bay secondary has gotten only one real test, which came in Week 2 against Atlanta. The test did not go well, leading to the Packers’ lone loss of the season. Wins against Cincinnati and Chicago are nice, of course, but they do not give much indication of what the Packers (3-1) can do against a balanced team like Dallas.\n",
      "In a Week 4 loss to Los Angeles, the Cowboys (2-2) picked up where they left off in the second half of their Week 3 win over Arizona, scoring touchdowns on three consecutive drives. The second half was a different story, as the Rams tightened and Dallas’s offense disappeared. Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott are talented enough to bounce back and put up points against Green Bay, but short of DeMarcus Lawrence, the Cowboys have relatively few defensive players who can intimidate Aaron Rodgers and the Packers’ offense.\n",
      "Pick: Packers\n",
      "Seahawks at Rams 4:05 p.m., CBS\n",
      "Line: Rams by 1 ½\n",
      "The Rams (3-1) have established a cohesive offensive strategy: Give the ball to Todd Gurley as often as possible. The third-year running back is averaging career highs in carries per game, rushing yards per game, receptions per game and receiving yards per game, and he leads Los Angeles in each of those categories. The bruising runner even showed off his receiving skills last week. Jared Goff saw him streaking down the middle of the field to take advantage of a safety’s having cheated toward the line of scrimmage and hit him for a sensational 53-yard catch-and-run. With all of the attention on Gurley, both as a runner and a receiver, Goff has time to find opportunities for Cooper Kupp and Sammy Watkins.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "Whether that offensive strategy can work against the Seahawks (2-2) is an open question, but Seattle certainly seems vulnerable despite a blowout win over the woeful Indianapolis Colts last week. Before that victory, Seattle had gone 1-2, with the win coming against the rebuilding San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks have allowed an ugly 134 yards a game on the ground, and that softness up front should be enticing for Gurley.\n",
      "If the Rams’ Wade Phillips-designed defense can play the way it did in the second half last week against Dallas, Los Angeles can take a commanding division lead. Pick: Rams\n",

      "Jaguars at Steelers 1 p.m., CBS\n",
      "Line: Steelers by 8\n",
      "The Jaguars (2-2) have been maddeningly inconsistent, but a pattern has emerged in the form of having the best pass defense and the worst run defense in the N.F.L. The Steelers’ Ben Roethlisberger is struggling to produce in the passing game, but conveniently for Pittsburgh (3-1), running back Le’Veon Bell appears to have shaken off a preseason slump. Add all of that up and Pittsburgh is likely to run the ball early and often against Jacksonville’s soft front seven, with Bell using his patience and speed to exploit any and all weaknesses. Pick: Steelers\n",
      "Cardinals at Eagles 1 p.m., Fox\n",
      "Line: Eagles by 6 ½\n",
      "Even without Fletcher Cox (calf injury), the Eagles (3-1) should be able to put plenty of pressure on Carson Palmer. When that happens, it can lead to bad things for the Cardinals (2-2), as Palmer has been turning the ball over way too much. When the Eagles have the ball, they will have to contend with Arizona’s opportunistic secondary. That could frustrate Carson Wentz, but with this game in Philadelphia, and with Arizona’s wins this season against Indianapolis and San Francisco, there is little reason to expect an upset.\n",

      "Line: Bengals by 3\n",
      "To the delight of Buffalo’s loyal fan base, the Bills (3-1) have rolled to a fast start. They were considered basement dwellers entering the season, but their record cannot be explained away as facing bad opponents, as two of their wins came against Denver and Atlanta. Their defense might actually be as good as it has looked thus far, but there is reason to believe Buffalo has played over its head, while the Bengals (1-3) have underperformed. Pick: Bengals\n",
      "Ravens at Raiders 4:05 p.m., CBS\n",
      "Line: Raiders by 2 ½\n",
      "Two weeks ago, the Raiders (2-2) looked incredible, and were off to the franchise’s first 2-0 start since 2002. But with Derek Carr sustaining a fracture in his back last week and Marshawn Lynch’s comeback tour running out of momentum, Oakland fans can be forgiven for letting some pessimism creep in. Oakland’s status as a contender is almost entirely dependent on how quickly and how well Carr can come back from his injury, but a win at home over the Ravens (2-2) seems possible even with E. J. Manuel replacing him. The Raiders’ situation certainly feels like one that Al Davis, the team’s longtime owner, would have tried to fix by signing Colin Kaepernick. Pick: Raiders\n",
      "Titans at Dolphins 1 p.m., CBS\n",
      "Line: N/A\n",
      "The Dolphins (1-2) are averaging 8.5 points a game. They have only two touchdowns in three games and appear to be in total disarray. Their best chance for a win has less to do with their quarterback, Jay Cutler, than it does with whoever is playing quarterback for the Titans (2-2). Marcus Mariota will almost assuredly tear Miami apart if he is healthy enough to play, but if the Titans are forced to turn to Matt Cassel, the game, which is Miami’s home opener, could be considerably closer. Pick: Titans\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "Jets at Browns 1 p.m., Fox\n",
      "Line: Browns by 1\n",
      "The Jets (2-2) are on a two-game winning streak, but they are slight underdogs against a winless team. While neither team can claim to be ready for prime time (even 1 p.m. may be too late in the day), Cleveland will at least get a boost from the debut of Myles Garrett, the defensive end drafted No. 1 over all by the Browns (0-4) this year. Combine that with the Jets having two fluky wins in a row and it feels as if it is Cleveland’s turn to harm its 2018 draft position with a win. Pick: Browns\n",
      "49ers at Colts 1 p.m., Fox\n",
      "Line: Colts by 1 ½\n",
      "Frank Gore is San Francisco’s career leader in rushing yards, but for the first time, he will be facing the 49ers (0-4) as a member of the Colts (1-3). Gore may no longer be the same player he once was — his average of 47.8 rushing yards a game is his lowest mark since his rookie season — but with 4 yards he will pass Eric Dickerson for seventh on the career rushing list. Every player ahead of Gore on the list is a Hall of Famer, as are six of the seven players below him. Pick: Colts\n",
      "Chargers at Giants 1 p.m., CBS\n",
      "Line: Giants by 3 ½\n",
      "No team wants to be winless after four weeks, and playoff hopes for the Chargers (0-4) and the Giants (0-4) are likely all but abandoned. A closer look, though, reveals Los Angeles has lost by 3 or fewer points in three of four games and the Giants have done the same thing twice. With a little more luck — especially in the kicking game for the Chargers — either team could be 2-2 or 3-1. That being said, both teams have been dreadful on offense, and this game could be ugly. Pick: Giants\n",

      "THE News IS: (Before It's News)\n",
      "Titans receiver Rishard Matthews was one of many NFL players that felt personally attacked by President Donald Trump’s comments against the NFL and its protesting players, most notably the “son of a bitch” reference, and he now plans to use his platform to advance the protest, Cameron Wolfe of ESPN.com reports.\n",
      "“I plan to kneel until the president apologizes for the comments that he made because I felt like those were very disrespectful comments that he made,” Matthews said on ESPN’s NFL Live Tuesday. “The league is made up of I think over 70 percent of African-Americans so the people that would be kneeling for this cause would be African-Americans. To keep it honest, he was calling a lot of us and he was calling me an S.O.B. and that’s not OK and very disrespectful. So, I plan to kneel until the president apologizes.”\n",
      "President Trump was asked about his issue with the NFL at the White House on Tuesday and said he was “ashamed of what was taking place” with players kneeling during the national anthem.\n",
      "“I wasn’t preoccupied with the NFL, I was ashamed of what was taking place,” he said, adding that “the NFL situation is a very important situation.”\n",
      "“Many people have died, many people have been horribly injured and they were fighting for our country, our flag, our national anthem, and for people to disrespect that by kneeling during the playing of our national anthem I think is disgraceful,” he said.\n",

      "THE News IS: The Red Sox could have said the same thing in 2009, when they lost twice in the best-of-five division round in Anaheim, then returned home to be swept by the Angels. It happened again last fall against the Cleveland Indians: two road losses, then a season-ending dud at Fenway.\n",
      "If the Red Sox lose on Sunday, they will have finished eight of their last nine seasons without a single playoff victory. The shining exception, of course, was 2013, when they won the World Series. Just two players from this postseason roster — Pedroia and shortstop Xander Bogaerts — were also on that one.\n",
      "“I don’t think, roster-wise, we probably had the best team going into that postseason,” Bogaerts said. “I know a lot of people didn’t pick us, but in the end, we did it. We did it as a team.”\n",
      "He added that those Red Sox faced a two-games-to-one World Series deficit in St. Louis but rallied to win the next three.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "“That was one of the hardest things to overcome, and we did it,” Bogaerts said. “It’s nothing that big, like that time.”\n",
      "So much has changed in just four years, especially with Boston’s offense. Those Red Sox led the majors in on-base plus slugging percentage. These Red Sox finished 22nd in O.P.S., at .736, far below even the sad and broken Mets. The nine other playoff teams held the top nine spots in that statistic.\n",
      "The old Boston standby David Ortiz now yuks it up with A-Rod on Fox’s postseason studio show. Their Red Sox’ cleanup man, Betts, gamely presses on with a wrist that recently needed a cortisone shot. It bothered Betts when he batted in the eighth inning on Friday, and he left for a defensive replacement.\n",

      "“Everything will be all right,” he said, referring to the wrist, not the team’s chances. Those hinge largely on Doug Fister, the journeyman right-hander who lost to the Astros last Friday. Fister has a strong playoff track record, but his earned run average was 4.88 this season. The Red Sox plucked him off the roster of the Class AAA Salt Lake Bees, an Angels affiliate, in June.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "They spent far more for their other starters. They traded gems from their farm system in deals for Sale and Pomeranz. In 2014, they traded the October stalwart Jon Lester to Oakland for Yoenis Cespedes, then flipped Cespedes to Detroit for Rick Porcello. They signed David Price in free agency for seven years and $217 million.\n",
      "So where do they stand now? Sale and Pomeranz — neither of whom had ever started in the playoffs before — combined to allow 11 runs and 14 hits in seven innings against the Astros. Price and Porcello have pitched in relief, Price because elbow trouble limits his workload, and Porcello because his rough season (11-17, 4.65) has knocked him from the rotation’s top three.\n",
      "These games have gone so miserably that Craig Kimbrel, the All-Star closer who strikes out nearly half of all hitters, was reduced to mop-up duty on Friday, just to stay sharp. He held the deficit at seven with a scoreless eighth inning.\n",
      "The Red Sox scored in the top of the ninth, but thankfully, nobody cited that as a show of character, or a willingness to fight to the end. It would have rung hollow, anyway, because the facts are clear: The Red Sox have had a nice season, with another A.L. East title. But their hitters cannot keep up with the Astros, and their pitchers cannot stop them.\n",
      "“Every single game, 1 through 9, everybody can do damage, everybody can go deep,” said Houston’s Carlos Correa, whose first-inning homer started the party on Friday. “There’s no holes in our lineup.”\n",
      "And there are just too many holes in the Red Sox.\n",

      "THE News IS: The new show arrives Oct. 11 on the CW, whose youth-centered programming has lately relied, with middling results, on superheroes. It has been not so much created as concocted by Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz — who sold soap to an Axe body wash generation with “Gossip Girl” and “The O.C.” — as a layer cake of nostalgia and novelty to tempt both extremes of the 18-49 demographic so coveted by advertisers.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "“We’re changing up the point of entry,” Mr. Schwartz said. “If you were a fan of the original, it honors the spirit of that. And then those new to the show should be ready for a fun, twisted serial.”\n",
      "“Downton Abbey” and “Billions” have showed that viewers still enjoy the foibles of the rich. But reboots have become iffy propositions, with originals readily available on Amazon Prime and in DVD box sets. The revival of “Dallas,” on TNT, was canceled after three seasons in 2014, even with the draw of original cast members. “Dynasty” has none thus far (one, Gordon Thomson, called the new show “an abomination” in an interview with The Daily Beast). Some fans, however, have hopefully proposed Heather Locklear, the original Sammy Jo and another “Melrose” veteran, to play Alexis, Cristal’s archrival.\n",
      "But she was nowhere in evidence here this summer on a cavernous soundstage, which was home to an update of the Carrington mansion, where this reporter spent many happy escapist hours as a pre-teen, learning nothing less than how to be a woman.\n",
      "“Lip-plumping treatments,” Mr. Show, compactly handsome at 55, was muttering in between takes, rolling the phrase around in his mouth like one of the top-shelf brandies Mr. Forsythe’s Blake Carrington favored. “Lip-plumping treatments.”\n",
      "Blake had just delivered to his headstrong daughter, Fallon (Elizabeth Gillies), the bad news that their family name had been trademarked by her mother, his ex-wife Alexis, for a cosmetics line.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "The “Dynasty” name was also tarnished by the time Mr. Show met Mr. Spelling, whose Holmby Hills, Calif., mansion seemed a version of Blake Carrington’s, on “Melrose.” He remembered the older man as strict and stingy, using so-called honey wagons to remove sewage rather than install proper plumbing, but also possessing a certain thespian gravitas.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "“Aaron used to say, putting his hands up and framing your face in a very square, ‘just your face’ way, ‘My shows are all about character,’” Mr. Show said during a break in taping, sitting at a dining table surrounded by expensive art. “He filmed straight-on, close to camera. You could tell an Aaron show in less than a second.”\n",
      "The new “Dynasty,” in contrast, has Ms. Savage and Mr Schwartz’s own distinct aesthetic. Scenes are shorter: three or four minutes as opposed to six or seven. Skirts are also shorter. Music is louder. Lighting is dimmer. Slo-mo is occasionally deployed. And knowing references are rife, including to Trumps, Kardashians and Murdochs.\n",
      "That the White House currently contains a real-estate tycoon— familiar from the ’80s, yet — and his scions makes “Dynasty” seem particularly resonant, though of course tangling bloodlines are a dramatic device as old as the ancient Greeks. “From the Clintons to the Kennedys, this isn’t a new thing, our fascination with these really powerful families,” said Nathalie Kelley, who plays Cristal. “But one thing we’ve talked about which is interesting is patriarchy — how much it has shifted, and how much it’s stayed the same.”\n",
      "The former Krystle (Linda Evans) had been Blake’s secretary, positioned in perpetual saintly opposition to the devious Alexis and meekly tiptoeing around the Carrington mansion like the nameless heroine of Daphne du Maurier’s “Rebecca.”\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "“In the original Blake is shutting the door in her face because she has to have a meeting and she’s trying to get a word in about the china or something,” Ms. Kelley said. “She’s not really given much to do besides be beautiful and look after the house.”\n",
      "This Cristal begins in public relations and goes on to contest fiercely with Fallon to become chief operating officer of the Carrington energy company.\n",
      "She is also young enough to be his daughter, though Ms. Kelley argued that at 33 she is past an age that could provoke eye rolls. “When I first met with Josh and Stephanie, I was like, ‘I think Cristal needs to be at least in her 30s,’” she said. “I don’t think women around the world are going to be happy with this rich billionaire in his 50s dating someone who’s under 30, and that threshold makes a big difference.”\n",
      "As Mr. Show put it: “People are younger today. The whole show’s younger.”\n",
      "Indeed if any demographic is neglected in the new version, it is the Modern Maturity set. Ms. Collins was 48 when she first swept into the courtroom when Blake was being tried for the murder of his son Steven’s male lover; Mr. Forsythe was 63. Later additions from the golden age of Hollywood, Diahann Carroll and Rock Hudson, were in their 50s — the latter’s death of AIDS in 1985 provoking a national conversation about whether he’d jeopardized Ms. Evans’s health with their onscreen kiss.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "As the cast awaits its Alexis, conflict has been heightened between Cristal and Fallon: a role played first by Pamela Sue Martin, then known for “Nancy Drew” and “The Poseidon Adventure,” and subsequently by the British actress Emma Samms, in one of those switcheroos that soap viewers are supposed to accept unblinkingly but now discuss for years afterward in searchable online forums. (A casting change for Steven was attributed to plastic surgery following an explosive accident on an oil rig, but producers decided simply to ignore Fallon’s change in appearance.)\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "As embodied by Ms. Gillies, Fallon has been upgraded from a somewhat lost soul, climbing in and out of beds and winsomely up trees — and later, on a spin-off called “The Colbys,” being abducted by aliens — to an ambitious businesswoman, still sleeping with the chauffeur but now also leaning in with a steely glare.\n",
      "Ms. Gillies, 24, said she had admired Ms. Collins since seeing her in “The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas” as a child and now regularly retweets the older woman’s Throwback Thursday hashtags to her own 4.6 million followers (thanks mainly to her role on “Victorious”). “I’m not playing Alexis but Fallon has inherited a lot of her gusto,” Ms. Gillies said. “She’s less passive than at least Pamela Sue Martin was — she had a relaxed nature. I wouldn’t say that my Fallon is as relaxed, for better or for worse. I think she’s got a lot more bite.”\n",
      "She is also entwined enough with Blake that some early viewers have suggested her character resembles Ivanka Trump, and for them Ms. Gillies has developed a one-line rejoinder: “I have better shoes,” she said, striding away in a pair of Christian Louboutin heels.\n",
      "Neither iteration of “Dynasty” can be separated from its devotion to materialism and the one percent. “I just have memories of how white the rooms were, the carpet — that’s what the rich have,” said Ms. Patrick, the showrunner, who grew up in Atlanta.\n",
      "But the very rich are not only different from you and me, but from how they used to be. The 2017 Colbys made their money in tech, the Carrington children are concerned about the environment and everyone accepts differences in race and sexual orientation unblinkingly. The once dithering Steven is now “gay and proud,” Ms. Patrick said. “That’s not his issue with his father; it’s that he’s a liberal.”\n",
      "Mr. Show said he thought “this Blake has a lot more pathology” than his predecessor. Crew members were hammering behind him at the opulent set, with its staircase built for flouncing down O‘Hara-style, and twinkling chandeliers.\n",
      "“He tells untruths when he doesn’t need to and I don’t know why yet, I’m developing the character,” Mr. Show said. “I’m taking that as seriously as I possibly can, and then it cuts to a catfight.”\n",

Picture taken on October 2, 2017. REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes\n",
      "BARINAS, Venezuela (Reuters) - Tirelessly traversing the lethargic plains of Venezuela, a brother of former leader Hugo Chavez and an ally of a famous opposition detainee vie for votes.\n",
      "The governorship race in Barinas state – the Chavez family’s stronghold - is the most emblematic of state elections taking place nationwide on Sunday just weeks after opposition-led protests that shook Venezuela and claimed at least 125 lives.\n",
      "“At every rally, Hugo Chavez is out front, showing us the way,” enthuses Argenis Chavez, 59, an electrical engineer and incumbent governor, jumping on a bike and evoking his late elder brother at every campaign stop.\n",
      "“In Barinas, defeating the government means defeating the Chavez family who have wielded power at whim for 18 years,” counters opposition rival Freddy Superlano, 41, wearing a shirt with the image of his arrested party leader Leopoldo Lopez.\n",
      "This year’s prolonged protests failed to bring down the government of President Nicolas Maduro, but they hardened global opinion against the ruling socialists and led to U.S. sanctions.\n",
      "Now, opposition leaders want their demoralized supporters to turn out en masse at the gubernatorial polls to overturn Maduro’s majority in 20 of Venezuela’s 23 states.\n",
      "The government, in turn, wants to minimize seemingly inevitable losses, and trumpet the election as proof against accusations of autocracy in Venezuela.\n",
      "“Look at our ‘dictatorship’ then: an election where most candidates are from the opposition!” Chavez ironically told Reuters, as red-shirted supporters danced around him at a rally.\n",
      "With voters angry over a crushing economic crisis, polls show the opposition coalition would win handily in normal circumstances. One recent survey gave the coalition, which aspires to win 18 governorships, 44.7 percent of voter intentions versus 21.1 percent for the government.\n",
      "SKEWED PLAYING FIELD?\n",
      "Circumstances are far from normal in Venezuela, however, and the government has threatened to ban any candidates linked to violence in protests.\n",
      "Furthermore, as in past elections during the ruling “Chavismo” movement’s 18-year grip on Venezuela, state resources are being mobilized heavily for official candidates.\n",
      "Distribution of subsidized food at government rallies is commonplace, state-run companies lend transport for the events, and state media give Maduro’s candidates unfettered air-time. One opposition candidate’s brother has been arrested for alleged car theft in what the coalition says is an attempt to intimidate its ranks.\n",
      "Perhaps the biggest disadvantage for the opposition is the electronic ballot sheet itself.\n",
      "Despite primaries to choose a single opposition candidate per state from the plethora of parties within the Democratic Unity coalition, the pro-Maduro election board is declining to modify the ballot list to narrow it down to one name.\n",
      "All initial candidates from before the primaries are listed on the ballot instead, something that could confuse opposition supporters and dilute their vote, benefiting the ruling Socialist Party’s candidates.\n",
      "The opposition Democratic Unity coalition candidate for Barinas state Freddy Superlano (C) talks with residents of a slum while campaigning on the outskirts of Barinas, Venezuela, October 3, 2017. Picture taken on October 3, 2017. REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes\n",
      "Further stoking opposition supporters’ skepticism, the election board is using a new vote machine provider after long-term partner Smartmatic accused it of inflating numbers in July’s controversial election of a Constituent Assembly super-body.\n",
      "“OPPOSITION WANTS WAR”\n",
      "On a walkabout in an unpaved shantytown on the outskirts of Barinas city, Superlano told Reuters government candidates were using helicopters to campaign while he and other opposition aspirants spent hours on the road to reach remote communities.\n",
      "The government was also exploiting Venezuelans’ hunger, during a period of unprecedented scarcity, by handing out food bags in return for promises of votes, he said.\n",
      "“It’s a macabre plan,” said Superlano, a lawmaker from Lopez’s Popular Will party who won the opposition primary in Barinas. “Even with all that, they are losing!”\n",
      "Having dealt a hugely symbolic blow to “Chavismo” by winning five of six congress seats for Barinas in 2015 elections, the opposition now wants to end 18 years of nearly unbroken control of the governorship by Chavez family members.\n",
      "Slideshow (15 Images)\n",
      "While there is widespread discontent over food shortages, idle land and rising malnutrition in a fertile region that should be Venezuela’s bread basket, the government is running a rigorous campaign and painting Superlano as “the candidate of the violence” in reference to this year’s protests.\n",
      "Maduro supporters say the opposition, backed by Venezuela’s elite and the U.S. government, is intent on taking power by force to seize control of the nation’s oil riches.\n",
      "“They want war for Venezuela. We want peace,” said 65-year-old retiree Ramon Alvarran, proudly wearing a red T-shirt depicting the eyes of Hugo Chavez at a rally for his brother.\n",
      "Elsewhere though, resentment against Maduro is palpable.\n",
      "“My kids don’t have a crumb in their stomachs yet today,” said Daris Gonzalez, 36, whose three children had not eaten by lunchtime. Like many in her poor and once staunchly “Chavista” neighborhood, Gonzalez is now leaning toward the opposition.\n",
      "“There has to be change. We cannot go on like this.”\n",
      "Offsetting such sentiment, many young grassroots opposition supporters feel their leaders have sold out - and betrayed the memory of slain protesters - by entering an election on an unfair playing field. Abstentions could hurt their numbers.\n",
      "Should the opposition triumph on Sunday, the government can limit the impact by restricting funding and taking authority away from the governors’ offices, as it has done in the past when offices have fallen to opponents.\n",
      "Any overt dirty tricks, however, risk bringing more international sanctions or torpedoing an already fragile, foreign-led mediation with the opposition that Maduro needs to improve his international image.\n",
      "Following the gubernatorial election, the opposition wants to shift attention to demanding a date, and guarantee of free conditions, for the 2018 presidential election to advance their ultimate goal of ending socialist rule.\n",
      "“People are very angry and their anger has a face: Maduro,” said Carlos Ocariz, an opposition candidate trying to hold Miranda state for the opposition against a rising star on the government side, Hector Rodriguez.\n",

      "THE News IS: (Before It's News)\n",
      "Now I have the police records 11 Sept 17\n",
      "Dear all sent this, I do not send all emails often as I know people have their own troubles. This though I want you all to know because without your support at the crucial time anything could have happened to me.\n",
      "After YEARS of trying to get a Section 7 Subject Access Request under the DPA 1998 Amended 2000, via Lancashire police, it still needed, even after I paid my £10 and took the 60 miles round trip to hand in my ID, the ICO involvement TWICE and now I have data they claimed did not exist.\n",
      "Among that I consider the wrongful arrest and false imprisonment, illegal detention of me from Nov 2015 to March 2016 with the threat of arrest as soon as I was released from The Orchard.\n",
      "The paperwork has all been changed.\n",
      "The custody records of 7/8/ Nov 2015 I had to get a solicitor to help me obtain them as AGAIN the Gestapo ignored all my requests, faxed or otherwise. It was the first custody record I have ever managed to get and that was the help of a solicitor who would accept no money. His firm had been duty solicitors that night of Nov 2015 and NOT told I was arrested and asking for a solicitor. I was deprived of that basic right as usual. He was intrigued. (Incidentally when his firm wrote to me about the arrest of Feb 2012, delivered to 298 Oxcliffe Rd when I rented caravan 1A in Aug 2012, the roughneck Diane Lennon was alerted and she one to pose as me, called to 298 and claimed MY mail freely handed to her by the landlady. When I found out and told the firm they wrote again and that also “disappeared”. I gave up.)\n",
      "I could see when analysing the data that details were incorrect and the FACTS had been recorded wrongly with INTENT. The odd thing then was they claimed they had no names of 3 “NHS professionals” in the station who “sectioned me”. There were other deliberately incorrect details but that is what I add here for you all.\n",
      "In my Sec 7 SAR, AFTER the Gestapo were sent my analysis of how the custody record was totally false, they obviously decided to revise it. Now they don’t even refer to LES MARSHALL who was used as apparently the proof I was mentally ill was that I could not recall speaking to him for about 2 hours. No, I said, I did not forget, I stated I had never heard of him, seen him, spoken to him at all. The NHS confirmed Marshall had not worked for them in Nov 2015, was not in the police station and had not worked for them for years. But see how proof of my stating that was “proof” I was mentally ill.\n",
      "Then more but the 3 on documents I have WERE NOT IN THE POLICE STATION THAT NIGHT AS I SAID ALL ALONG BUT NO ONE WOULD LISTEN. IT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO FIND OUT. I found out but after I was released.\n",
      "What about the arrests: 1) “following someone to a local airport” aside from the fact we don’t have one – deleted from the records. 2) “harassing an 83 year old woman” (how was not stated) when I don’t know any – deleted from the records. 3) “taking photos of children” – deleted from the records. 4) “following someone to Kendal” no date, no person named,- deleted from the records. 5) “Someone (unnamed) had an injunction ordering me not to write to them” so as I pointed out the lunacy in that was that a person who did not know me went to the expense of going to court to ask for an injunction against me so I would not write to her (I am sure HER was referred to) as if a judge would do that! The solicitor I went to see to help me get the custody records made enquiries about that; there was never any injunction at all as he was sure there could not be on such drivel.\n",
      "The latest “custody record” now has a NEW solicitor named as being on duty that night, one from Preston. AND THAT SHEET OF PAPER HAS MY SIGNATURE AS IF I HAD SEEN IT AND SIGNED. My signature is a photocopied one from the one the solicitor obtained for me. And on those custody records, there is no “south Lancaster” solicitor named at all; it is northern division.\n",
      "And for those who still think I make things up then they have to conceded that my documents are scotch mist.\n",
      "But for all of you who rang and made noises, you were right, I was right, they were wrong. Carol.\n",
      "PS on a cheerful note, the Gestapo records show how they raised FOR POLICE EYES ONLY incident numbers for my “serious crimes” not exposed. One was “She has written to the Crime Commissioner”. I kid you not, there it is in black and white and other such utter rubbish.\n",

      "THE News IS: The same week Uber was given notice in London, Mark Zuckerberg sat down in front of a camera in Menlo Park, Calif. His desaturated earth-tone palette was matched color for color by his office in the background, as if to provide camouflage. Indeed, it was easy to miss the sheer range and strangeness of what he was there to say. “I care deeply about the democratic process and protecting its integrity,” he said. “The integrity of our elections is fundamental to democracy around the world.”\n",
      "Facebook had recently disclosed that it believed Russian state actors purchased political ads during the 2016 election; more broadly, it had been accused of allowing disinformation and misinformation to thrive on its platform. Among the measures that Zuckerberg said his company would take included expanding “partnerships” with election commissions around the world and “working proactively to strengthen the democratic process.” Most striking, coming from the C.E.O. of a publicly traded American social-media company, was this line: “We have been working to ensure the integrity of the German elections this weekend.”\n",
      "Social-media companies aren’t new to defending themselves in ideological terms — they’re just not used to doing it on their home turf. While to authoritarian regimes, the threat of social media is obvious, in the United States, Facebook, Twitter and Google have for years talked about themselves freely in the language of democracy, participation and connectivity. The emerging tension between internet platforms and democratic governments, however, seems to stem less from their obvious rhetorical differences than from their similarities.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "Facebook’s transition from a confident stride to a guarded crouch was conspicuous and sudden, arriving roughly at the same time as President Trump. Shortly after the 2016 election, Zuckerberg dismissed heated claims that misinformation on his platform had gotten Trump elected as a “pretty crazy idea.” In September, he admitted that his comment was dismissive, but did so after months of near-constant scrutiny, including, according to The Washington Post, a postelection lecture from President Obama. In an interview with Bloomberg published in September, he sounded more wistful than irritated: “For most of the existence of the company, this idea of connecting the world has not been a controversial thing,” he said. “Something changed.” It certainly had: Facebook was being implicated as potentially harmful to the systems within which it had thrived, and with which it had sought to identify itself.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "The problem was that Facebook had outgrown every context except its own. Though it neither thinks like nor resembles a government, it has effectively sewn itself into the fabric of users’ public and personal lives. Facebook accounts have now become something like IDs, enabling an ever-growing range of activities: commerce, job-seeking, leisure. Networks stand in for community; encryption, in owned and operated services like WhatsApp, stands in for guarantees of liberty; newsfeeds become sources of diverse information, including ads, yes, but also calls to register to vote — to apply elsewhere what you’ve increasingly experienced online.\n",
      "All this is to say that a sufficiently successful social platform is experienced, much like Uber, as a piece of infrastructure. Except, instead of wrapping its marketplace around a city’s roads, Facebook makes a new market around communication, media and civil society. This, from a founder’s perspective, is an electrifying outcome. But this cultural metastasis has led to a swift and less-than-discriminate backlash. Already, calls for regulating the largest internet platforms are growing louder while remaining tellingly vague. After all, what can a government realistically do about a problem like Facebook?\n",
      "It’s very likely that any approach to regulating Facebook will look more like diplomacy than anything else — a cautious search for détente with an institution that ultimately gets to set its own laws, whether a government likes it or not. Indeed, the company has been presenting itself as a willing, generous participant in American investigations, but more generally as a supranational, self-regulating force for good, and, boldly, as indispensable for the continuation of democracy around the world. “We will do our part not only to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world,” Zuckerberg said, “but also to give everyone a voice and to be a force for good in democracy everywhere.” For citizen users, it’s a gesture of good faith. To skeptical countries, it’s a gentle declaration of independence, or maybe a dare. For Facebook, it’s something distinct, new and unmistakably statelike: a claim of sovereignty.\n"

      "THE News IS: LONDON (Reuters) - A special production of the 1960s rock musical “Hair”, tweaked for the age of Trump, premieres in London this week to mark the ground-breaking show’s 50th anniversary.\n",
      "The show, staged in London’s Vaults theater, features updates to the dialogue and song lyrics written by James Rado, who wrote the show with Germoe Ragni in the 1960s, to comment on contemporary politics.\n",
      "Among the updates, characters sing about making “America stronger,” - a reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan. The new production also features new scenes and other dialogue.\n",
      "“I think what Jim (Rado) wanted to do was just make it a little bit more apparent and clear that America and other Western countries, including Britain, haven’t necessarily moved forward as quickly as we’d hoped,” director Jonathan O‘Boyle, told Reuters.\n",
      "“Hair” follows the fortunes of The Tribe - a group of hippies fighting conscription into the Vietnam war in 1960s New York.\n",
      "Cast members perform during a rehearsal of Hair at The Vaults theatre in London, Britain, October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n",
      "It was highly controversial upon its first release for its full-frontal nudity, liberal depiction of drug taking and irreverent treatment of the American flag, which was displayed up-side down and laid on the floor.\n",
      "The show had lengthy runs on Broadway and on London’s West End, and songs like “Aquarius” and “Good Morning Starshine” helped the original Broadway cast recording sell almost three million copies.\n",
      "Slideshow (7 Images)\n",
      "Despite the social and political changes since the show’s creation, its themes of racism, fears of nuclear war - and it’s irreverent treatment of the American flag - mean that is still relevant to the current political discussion.\n",
      "“Everything that hippies were fighting for then, is still needing to be fought for today,” said Andy Coxon, who plays hippy George Berger. “You’d be surprised how much things haven’t changed. A lot has, we still have a way to go.”\n",
      "And would the U.S. president himself, currently embroiled in a row over American football players kneeling during the playing of the national anthem in protest, approve of the show?\n",
      "“He’d probably hate it,” said O‘Boyle.\n",

      "THE News IS: Mr. Collins and company have indeed sent in cousins of those clowns to wreak havoc on Shakespeare’s dark comic drama of judgment, mercy and sexual hypocrisy. Sometimes these demolition experts are pretty funny. But if you don’t already know “Measure for Measure” — and it’s an uncommonly hard play to know — you’ll need NoDoz to stay engaged.\n",
      "Frustration and even defeat are not unusual responses to “Measure for Measure,” which is set in a medieval, vice-ridden Vienna in which fornication before marriage is punishable by death. That law has gone long unenforced when the play begins, so the enigmatic Duke of Vienna (Scott Shepherd) decides to step aside and put the merciless puritan Angelo (Pete Simpson) in charge.\n",
      "But even as he sends police into the city’s bars and brothels, Angelo is wrestling with illicit desires of his own. He finds himself inconveniently in lust with Isabella (Rinne Groff), a convent novitiate, when she comes to plead for the life of her brother, Claudio (Greig Sargeant), condemned for premarital sex. All the while, the Duke, disguised as a lowly friar, observes from the shadows.\n",
      "The scholar Harold Bloom has described “Measure for Measure” as a nihilistic “comedy that destroys comedy.” It is a work that combines psychosexual portraiture that anticipates Freud with stock farcical figures like the illiterate cop and various rascally lowlifes. It does not have a single sympathetic character, and every philosophical principle seems to be contradicted by another.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "I usually lower my expectations for “Measure,” which contemporary directors like to trick out in (yawn) S&M and Storm Trooper regalia. The most persuasive version I’ve ever seen, from Fiasco Theater in 2014, refrained from interpretive gloss, and let the play’s paradoxes speak eloquently for themselves. But even in over-conceptualized versions, there’s usually at least one, thought-provoking portrayal that illuminates.\n",
      "Mr. Collins’s production does feature one such performance, from Mr. Shepherd (more on whom later). Mostly, though, it translates the challenges of a notorious problem play into “oh, why not?” parlor tricks and slapstick.\n",
      "Much of the intermissionless, two-hours-plus show is conducted at a rushing tempo that defies comprehension. Often, the words being spoken are simultaneously seen (via Eva von Schweinitz’s projections) sliding down the walls of Jim Findlay’s multi-table set, which suggests the shabby boardroom of an underfinanced company.\n",

      "The performers, wearing Kaye Voyce’s jauntily eclectic costumes, alternately sit, like extras on a movie set, or rush around in high frenzy, scattering papers and props. (I half expected them to start singing, “You say tragedy, I say comedy,” concluding with, “Let’s call the whole thing off.”) And then a silence falls for the Act Three scene in which Isabella explains to Claudio why she cannot sacrifice her maidenhood (to Angelo) to save him from the executioner’s block.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "Ms. Groff’s Isabella, dressed to resemble a Tennessee Williams spinster, and Mr. Sargeant’s Claudio speak their exchange plainly and slowly. And it suddenly registers that within all the pious bureaucratic double-talk we’ve been hearing lie matters of genuine life and death. It is an ingeniously placed revelation, and it registers intellectually, if not emotionally.\n",
      "The lack of affect has to do with the absence of any character definition beyond the archetypal. While I enjoyed the vaudeville neuroses of Mr. Simpson’s Angelo, only one actor told me anything new about “Measure for Measure.”\n",
      "That’s Mr. Shepherd, whose narrator in “Gatz” was one of the great virtuosic performance of recent years. Here he portrays the “fantastical duke of dark corners” as an exuberant escapee from the House of Windsor, an inbred composite of all the 20th century princes of Wales, including Charles.\n",
      "This Duke has the enthusiastic but distractible air of a nobleman who has been conditioned to see the world as his personal Erector Set. While his character’s erratic behavior has inspired centuries of debate, Mr. Shepherd suggests that the most accurate interpretation is the simplest.\n",
      "The Duke acts as he does because he can. He’s the Duke! Like the spoiled and glamorous aristocrats of “The Great Gatsby,” he careers through the lives of lesser mortals, without explanation, leaving others to clean up his mess.\n",
      "Come to think of it, this feckless man who would be God might have directed the arbitrary production in which he appears.\n",

You rarely see people get really emotional. People are just very, very honest about where they’re at, and it’s almost more striking in a way. I’ve been to so many places where the suffering is so massive and people really are upset. And here the suffering is just as bad if not worse.\n",

      "What about the politics of this? Are there people in the camps talking about any of that?\n",
      "I think people are just really happy to be here, to be honest.\n",
      "Something that’s really striking to me — and that’s only because maybe that I’m here and experiencing it — is to look at the way that not only the Myanmar government but also the Myanmar population is reacting to all this, which is basically to deny it.\n",

      "Damien: What have you made of the response in Myanmar, Hannah, especially from the country’s leader (and Nobel Peace Prize winner), Daw Aung San Suu Kyi?\n",
      "Hannah: It’s complicated. I think that when she became the de facto leader of the Myanmar government last year, there was this wish from the international community that we would have this feel-good narrative.\n",
      "In Asia, it’s been a story of the rollback of democracy, and so here was just one story where there was this peaceful transition from a military junta that ruled for almost 50 years to a civilian leader — this democracy activist, this Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "And the truth of the matter is that she is still very, very constrained, and the military controls a lot of things — and controls the people who are committing what seem to be atrocities in the Rohingya areas in northern Rakhine state and in western Myanmar.\n",
      "Having said that, she is the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and the one weapon that she has that the military doesn’t have is her moral authority — and she has not used it. And so I think that the international community has every right to call her and say: “Look, you know we understand that your position is very difficult. But if you don’t speak out for these people, then who will?”\n",

      "You’re a relatively newly installed bureau chief for The Times in Southeast Asia, though you’ve been covering the region for years. What else are you looking at in the region?\n",
      "The thing about Southeast Asia is it’s 11 countries or so, all of which are very different. And nothing really ties them together except, I would say, maybe two things.\n",
      "One is the fact that democracy has been seriously challenged throughout the region. You look at Thailand, where I am now, which is now ruled by a military junta. You have Myanmar, which has this kind of quasi-civilian government. You look at Malayasia, where there are allegations of corruption and a rollback of rights, and the Philippines, where you have a leader who has publicly endorsed a fatal drug war. You have Indonesia, which is kind of the shining light of democracy in the region but has serious ethnic and religious issues of its own.\n",
      "The other issue is a religious change, and it relates to Myanmar as well. There you have this divide between a Buddhist majority nation and a Muslim minority. In Thailand you have the similar thing — you have a country that is about 90 percent Buddhist with, in the south, a Muslim insurgency.\n",
      "And then you have places like Malaysia and Indonesia, where it’s majority Muslim but there are significant religious minorities chafing against the majority. So you have these kind of religious fault lines throughout the region that I think are something we’re really paying attention to.\n",

      "THE News IS: By Brandon Smith\n",
      "I remember back in mid-2013 when the Federal Reserve fielded the notion of a “taper” of quantitative easing measures. More specifically, I remember the response of mainstream economic analysts as well as the alternative economic community. I argued fervently in multiple articles that the Fed would indeed follow through with the taper, and that it made perfect sense for them to do so given that the mission of the central bank is not to protect the U.S. financial system, but to sabotage it carefully and deliberately. The general consensus was that a taper of QE was impossible and that the Fed would “never dare.” Not long after, the Fed launched its taper program.\n",
      "Two years later, in 2015, I argued once again that the Fed would begin raising interest rates even though multiple mainstream and alternative sources believed that this was also impossible. Without low interest rates, stock buybacks would slowly but surely die out, and the last pillar holding together equities and the general economy (besides blind faith) would be removed. The idea that the Fed would knowingly take such an action seemed to be against their “best self interest;” and yet, not long after, they initiated the beginning of the end for artificially low interest rates.\n",
      "The process that the Federal Reserve has undertaken has been a long and arduous one cloaked in disinformation. It is a process of dismantlement. Through unprecedented stimulus measures, the central bank has conjured perhaps the largest stock and bond bubbles in history, not to mention a bubble to end all bubbles in the U.S. dollar.\n",
      "Stocks in particular are irrelevant in the grand scheme of our economy, but this does not stop the populace from using them as a reference point for the health of our system. This creates an environment rife with delusion, just as the open flood of cheap credit created considerable delusion before the crash of 2008.\n",
      "Today, we find our economic fundamentals in complete disarray, but the overwhelming fantasy within stocks still remains. Why? Because yet again, for some reason, no one is ready to accept the reality that the Fed is pulling the plug on America’s fiscal life support. Nary a handful of economists in the world think that the Fed will raise interest rates one more time this year if ever again, and the threat of a balance sheet reduction is the furthest thing from everyone’s mind. Daytrading investors are utterly convinced they have the Fed by the short hairs. I say, the situation is actually in reverse.\n",
      "The minutes from the Fed’s July Open Market Committee Meeting indicate that while the central bank has been the savior of stock investors for several years, the party is about to end. Comments on the risks a bull market might pose to “financial stability” have been more frequent the past couple of months\n",
      "Only a few weeks ago, former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan commented that bond markets could collapse and bring stocks down with them do to overvaluations and increasing interest rates.\n",
      "Recent spikes in markets despite a steady stream of natural disasters, threats of war with North Korea, as well is “increased inflation” (according to Fed models) due to the damage wrought by Hurricane Harvey suggest that the Fed will indeed continue hiking rates into our ongoing financial collapse.\n",
      "The next FOMC meeting will conclude on the 20th of this month, and the question is, will the Fed surprise with a rate hike and/or balance sheet reduction program? I believe the odds are much higher than many people seem to think.\n",
      "First, let’s be clear, historically the Fed’s predictable behavior has been to skip major policy actions in September and then startle markets with renewed and aggressive actions in December. People placing bets on a Fed rate hike in September would look at this pattern and say “no way.” However, the narrative I see building in Fed rhetoric and in the mainstream media is that stock markets have become “unruly children” and that the Fed must become a “stern parent,” reining them in before they are crushed under the weight of their own naive enthusiasm.\n",
      "In my view, the Fed will continue to do what it says it is going to do — raise interest rates and reduce and remove stimulus, and that the mainstream narrative will soon be adjusted to suggest that this is “necessary;” that stock markets need a bit of tough love.\n",
      "If the Fed means to follow through with its stated plans for “financial stability” in markets, then the only measure that would be effective in shell-shocking stocks back to reality would be a surprise hike, a surprise announcement of balance sheet reduction or both at the same time.\n",
      "If the Fed intends to continue cutting off life support to equities and bonds in preparation for a controlled demolition of the U.S. economy, then there is a high probability at the very least of a balance sheet reduction announcement this week with strong language indicating another rate hike in December. I also would not completely rule out a surprise rate hike even though September is usually a no-action month for central banks.\n",
      "This would fit the trend of central banks around the globe strategically distancing themselves from artificial support for the financial structure. Last week, the Bank of England surprised investors with an open indication that they may begin raising interest rates “in the coming months.” The Bank Of Canada surprised some economists with yet another rate hike this month and mentions of “more to come.” The European Central Bank has paved the way for a tapering of stimulus measures according to comments made during its latest meeting early this month. And, the Bank of Japan initiated taper measures in July.\n",
      "Even Forbes is admitting that there appears to be a “coordinated tightening of monetary policy” coming far sooner than the mainstream expects. If you understand how the Bank for International Settlements controls policy initiatives of national central bank members, then you should not be surprised that central banks all over the world are pursuing the same actions and the same rhetoric. The only difference between any of them is the pace they have chosen in taking the punch away from the party.\n",
      "The point is, when it comes to the fiat peddlers, there are indeed a few sure things, but continued stimulus is not one of them. One thing that is certain is that they will act in concert as they are clearly doing now in terms of policy tightening. Another thing that is certain is that if they plant a notion in the mainstream media — such as the notion that they are “worried about overvaluations in stocks” and that interest rates must rise, then they will follow through as they always have. Perhaps not at the pace the mainstream expects, or the pace I expect, but certainly somewhere in-between.\n",
      "Finally, it behooves me to mention again that the Fed has done all of this before. In the lead up to the stock market crash of 1929, the central bank bloated stocks with easy credit measures and low interest rates, only to hike rates in the name of “quelling inflation.” This hacked the legs out from under markets with a machete, and the rest is history. The hidden purpose behind this tactic is extraordinary centralization on a global scale. The Fed is not interested in the health of the U.S. economy, it is interested in total globalization of all economies under one totalitarian umbrella. To make an omelet, you have to break a few eggs.\n",
      "Of course, the Fed will not engineer a market crash in a vacuum. It is my suspicion that the next Fed meeting will be followed by a geopolitical distraction — the most likely candidate being increasing conflict with North Korea. Do not be fooled by the magic show. The real threat to us all is the central banking and international banking apparatus, including the BIS and the IMF. From now until the end of this year, remain vigilant.\n",

      "THE News IS: WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish anti-monopoly office said that Poland’s biggest power firm PGE PGE.WA can take over the local assets of France’s EDF (EDF.PA) on condition that it sells most of the electricity generated by the Rybnik coal-fueled power plant via the power exchange.\n",
      "State-run PGE agreed to buy EDF’s local power and heating plants for 4.51 billion zlotys ($1.23 billion) in May in a move to increase its market share and give the state more control over the country’s utilities.\n",
      "EDF’s assets include eight combined heat and power plants and a 1.8 gigawatt (GW) coal-fired power plant in Rybnik in southern Poland.\n",
      "The deal, which has been supported by Poland’s energy ministry, was unexpectedly questioned in September by the anti-monopoly office UOKiK, which said that the transaction could undermine competition in the energy market.\n",
      "After buying EDF assets PGE’s share of the country’s power generation capacity would rise to 45 from 36 percent, the energy minister said.\n",
      "“UOKiK issued an approval for PGE’s takeover of EDF Polska,” the office said in a statement on Thursday, adding that its condition is that in 2018-2021 PGE will have to sell all the power generated in Rybnik via the power exchange.\n",
      "“The boost of PGE’s market position will be reduced. All the electricity which has been up to date generated by EDF Polska and sold to wholesale clients, will be directed to the exchange. None of the entrepreneurs interested in buying the electricity will be discriminated against,” the head of UOKiK said in a statement.\n",
      "PGE, which plans to conclude the deal by the end of 2017, said it will not impact power prices for customers.\n",
      "“In our view this will have a positive impact on the market. We do not expect any electricity price movements related with this transaction,” PGE Chief Executive Henryk Baranowski told a news conference on Thursday.\n",
      "He added that PGE will not require a loan to finance the deal.\n",
      "Shares in PGE were up 1 percent at 0801 GMT on a flat market.\n",

      "THE News IS: NASA and the Russian space agency Roscosmos have announced a new partnership for human exploration of the moon and deep space. Both agencies signed a joint statement on the collaborative effort. It all stems from NASA’s “deep-space gateway” concept, a mission architecture designed to send astronauts into lunar orbit by 2020 (the statement sets a mid-2020s goal for beginning the project.)\n",
      "“This plan challenges our current capabilities in human spaceflight and will benefit from engagement by multiple countries and U.S. industry,” NASA officials said in a statement.\n",
      "“While the deep space gateway is still in concept formulation, NASA is pleased to see growing international interest in moving into cislunar space as the next step for advancing human space exploration,” Robert Lightfoot, NASA’s acting administrator, said in a statement.\n",
      "“Statements such as this one signed with Roscosmos show the gateway concept as an enabler to the kind of exploration architecture that is affordable and sustainable,” Lightfoot added.\n",
      "In a separate statement, Roscosmos officials said the new partnership would “develop international technical standards for the establishment of the station in the near-moon orbit.”\n",
      "The idea was first reported in January by The Atlantic before President Donald Trump’s inauguration. The publication wrote that Trump was “eyeing building a moon base.” It’s a long-standing goal by Newt Gingrich, one of Trump’s advisers.\n",
      "This comes as the recently resurrected U.S. National Space Council (NSC) plans its first meeting for October 5th.\n",
      "The meeting, titled “Leading the Next Frontier: An Event with the National Space Council,” will be held at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.\n",
      "“At President Trump’s direction, the kick-off meeting of the National Space Council will bring together all aspects and sectors of the national space enterprise for the first time in a quarter-century,” Pence said in a statement. “This meeting will provide an opportunity for the Administration to lay out its vision for space exploration. As President Trump said, ‘We’re a nation of pioneers, and the next great American frontier is space.'”\n",
      "At @POTUS‘ direction, the Nat’l Space Council will hold first meeting with all aspects of space enterprise for 1st time in a quarter century pic.twitter.com/3YBiNUTV6l — Vice President Pence (@VP) September 26, 2017\n",
      "Trump resurrected the National Space Council by signing an executive order on June 30th in order to steer the future of American space policy. The council was last active in the early 1990s during President George H.W. Bush’s administration. Pence chairs the reinstated council, with aerospace veteran Scott Pace serving as executive secretary to the committee.\n",
      "In June, Congress voted under the defense authorization 2018 bill on forming a “new” sixth branch of the military called “Space Corps” which would take over Air Force Space Command Operations and likely Naval Space Operations.\n",
      "While the plans are allegedly “new,” in the 1950s the Army drafted up plans for what was known as Project Horizon.\n",
      "Project Horizon was the need to establish a stationary Army control base on the moon by 1966. That operation was allegedly shut down and canceled, and the idea never materialized. It’s also not the only advanced space technology project that was canceled, as this article will document. A concept picture of the base is below.\n",
      "Ironically, one year prior in 1965, the Russian Probe ZOND-3 captured suggestive pics of the moon showing what looks like a dome and a large tower.\n",
      "Russian Probe ZOND-3 PICS (1965) Army Proposed Moon Base #ProjectHorizon In 1959 Documents: https://t.co/zhu0GCpB3L 😎👤 pic.twitter.com/gnZHfnbvY7 — AKilluminati (AK)🔹‏ (@An0nKn0wledge) March 13, 2017\n",
      "Unlike Project Horizon, the newly proposed plan is an orbital station that will orbit the moon as opposed to a stationary base on the moon’s surface.\n",
      "Instead, the current plan resembles another previous proposal called the MOL (Manned Orbiting Laboratory) which was suggested during the Cold War.\n",
      "The MOL ran from December 1963, until its alleged cancellation in June 1969. Its mission was to use an elite corps of secret U.S. astronauts to gather intelligence on the Soviets during the Cold War. This historical fact proves that secret astronauts were proposed and may exist today in black ops known as Special Access Programs or SAPS.\n",
      "A quote from President Ronald Reagan on June, 11th 1985 seems to allude to that fact. Reagan wrote in his diary that he had been told about a “space shuttle that carries 300 men” when having lunch with five of the top scientists at the time.\n",
      "Interestingly enough, this was just four years before the New York Times reported that the Air Force’s space program had been canceled by the Pentagon. In 1989, the New York Times reported that the Air Force had shut down another planned manned space program which sought a staff of 32 astronauts and a space shuttle launching facility in Colorado. It’s important to note that modern space shuttles only carry eight passengers maximum, so 32 would be an accomplishment indeed. The space facility and project cost an estimated minimum of $5 billion dollars, so why would they shut it down?\n",
      "It was also reported in April of this year that plans are in the works by China and Europe to “build” a joint lunar command for their own future space endeavors. This project more closely resembles Project Horizon, a stationary joint command structure.\n",
      "While these ideas have been around for fifty plus years and have likely been completed, they will tell the public these ideas are new. Are we finally witnessing disclosure? For further documentation on the existence of an SSP or Secret Space Program see my previous article “The Origins and 50 Years Of Evidence Of A Secret Space Program,” on Steemit!\n",

      "THE News IS: (The Sports Xchange) - NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith released a statement Monday regarding players protesting during the national anthem, saying “no player is disrespecting our country or our flag.”\n",
      "Smith’s statement comes following Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones’ comments on Sunday that his players must stand for the anthem or else they would not play.\n",
      "In addition, Vice President Mike Pence left Sunday’s game in Indianapolis when the visiting San Francisco 49ers knelt during the national anthem before facing the Colts.\n",
      "”Last week both the Commissioner and the Chair of the NFL Management Council John Mara were clear when they assured our union leaders, in the presence of other owners, that they would respect the Constitutional rights of our members without retribution,“ Smith said in a statement. ”I look forward to the day when everyone in Management can unite and truly embrace and article what that Flag stands for: ‘Liberty and Justice for All’ instead of some of them just talking about standing. We look forward to continuing our talks with them on this very issue.\n",
      "“No player is disrespecting our Country or our Flag. As thousands have shown in the past, it takes bravery and courage to speak and confront these issues as our players have, especially when it is unpopular with some. There is room for Management to do the same and maybe then players do not have to risk the taunts and threats alone. This is their opportunity to lead as well and will be a true test of the motto that ‘Football is Family.'”\n",
      "Jones’ comments occurred in response to Pence abruptly leaving Sunday’s game after more than 20 49ers knelt during the national anthem.\n",
      "“Understand? We will not ... if we are disrespecting the flag, then we will not play. Period,” Jones said after the Cowboys’ 35-31 home loss to the Green Bay Packers.\n",
      "Before the Cowboys’ game at Arizona on Sept. 25, Jones and members of his family joined the players, coaches and staff on the field prior to the anthem. They kneeled and locked arms. When the anthem was performed, they stood arm-in-arm with the players.\n",
      "The gesture was in response to President Donald Trump’s comments that NFL owners should fire players who disrespect the flag by not standing during the national anthem.\n",
      "Cowboys defensive ends Damontre Moore and David Irving raised their fists at the end of the anthem before the game against the Packers, according to the Dallas Morning News. Jones said he was unaware of their actions.\n",
      "Aug 5, 2017; Canton, OH, USA; Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones delivers his acceptance speech during the Professional Football HOF enshrinement ceremonies at the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n",
      "Pence, a former governor of Indiana, was on hand to celebrate former Colts quarterback Peyton Manning’s induction into the franchise’s Ring of Honor.\n",
      "No Colts players knelt during the anthem prior to the game but the 49ers had more than 20 players kneeling with their hands over their hearts for the second straight week.\n",
      "“I left today’s Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem,” Pence tweeted about leaving the game:\n",
      "About an hour later, Trump tweeted that Pence was acting in response to his instructions.\n",
      "“I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen,” Trump tweeted.\n",
      "NBC News reported Sunday that reporters were told before the game there could be “an early departure” by Pence.\n",
      "Trump followed up Monday morning with another tweet: “The trip by @VP Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!”\n",
      "Trump’s position unified more NFL players to protest racial injustice before or during the anthem. He said during a political rally in Huntsville, Ala., on Sept. 22 that NFL owners should fire the players who knelt during the anthem.\n",
      "“We’re proud of our country. We respect our flag,” Trump said to loud applause at the campaign event. “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out. He’s fired! He’s fired!'”\n",
      "Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick drew national attention last season when he knelt during the national anthem as a protest against racial injustice. A number of players followed Kaepernick’s lead by taking a knee during the anthem last year.\n",
      "NFL players who have demonstrated during the national anthem have said they are protesting police brutality and racism, but not the flag or the anthem itself.\n",

      "THE News IS: Four Los Angeles relievers combined to preserve a three-hitter. Kenley Jansen worked around a single by David Peralta for a three-out save, striking out Paul Goldschmidt to end it. Only four batters reached base all night for the Diamondbacks, including Daniel Descalso with a homer.\n",
      "“It was about finishing them off,” Darvish said, “because momentum can go their way.”\n",
      "The Dodgers, who won 104 games for the best record in baseball and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, face the winner of the Nationals-Cubs series in the NLCS. Los Angeles fell there to World Series champion Chicago last year.\n",
      "The Dodgers confined most of their celebration to the clubhouse, never making a move for the pool beyond the outfield wall. Los Angeles distressed the locals by taking a dip there after clinching the NL West in 2013, but for this party, police officers on horses waited at the warning track to keep the Dodgers away.\n",
      "That was fine by the Dodgers. This wasn’t the bash they’re after, anyway.\n",
      "“Being around this team for long enough, this is where we expect to be,” ace Clayton Kershaw said. “We are fortunate enough to be in a big market, have a big payroll, have a lot of good players, a lot of talent. They did a great job of putting this team together. They expect us to be here and we expect us to be here, too.”\n",
      "Bellinger hit his homer in the fifth, then made a daring catch to end the bottom of the inning. The rookie first baseman fell into the Dodgers dugout as he snagged Jeff Mathis’ pop-up, nearly dropping into the lap of manager Dave Roberts.\n",
      "“I should have been a little quicker to save him,” Roberts said, “but that was a heck of a play.”\n",

      "The 22-year-old Bellinger is the youngest Dodger ever to homer in the postseason — he’s 75 days younger than Corey Seager was when he set the mark last fall. Bellinger was just 1 for 12 with five strikeouts in his first postseason before hitting Greinke’s 3-1 pitch over the wall in left for a 2-0 lead.\n",
      "Bellinger, who may follow Seager as NL Rookie of the Year, also brought home Chris Taylor with a groundout in the first inning. Barnes chased Greinke with a leadoff homer in the sixth.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "After Ketel Marte’s first-inning bunt single, Darvish sent down 13 in a row before Descalso hit his second homer of the series. The two-out shot barely cleared the right-field fence over Yasiel Puig’s glove to cut the lead to 2-1.\n",
      "The Dodgers tinkered with Darvish’s mechanics after the trade, and he was masterful through most of the night, mixing a 98 mph fastball with his deep repertoire of off-speed pitches. He allowed two hits and didn’t walk any over 74 pitches.\n",
      "“Yu really stepped up,” Roberts said. “He was in command from the first pitch.”\n",
      "Darvish left after hitting pinch-hitter Christian Walker in the bill of his helmet to begin the sixth.\n",
      "Greinke — the ex-Dodger signed to a $206.5 million, six-year contract by Arizona before the 2016 season — gave up three runs and four hits in five-plus innings. He struggled with his command, walking a season-high five and throwing 103 pitches through five innings. Greinke faced 3-2 counts against five of his first eight batters and was at 54 pitches through two innings.\n",
      "“They’re ready to hit, which is tough, but they’re not chasing the pitch you want them to chase,” Greinke said. “That’s kind of what they do best. They did that the whole series.”\n",
      "Arizona won its last six regular-season games against the Dodgers, but Los Angeles dominated its NL West rival when it mattered most, sweeping an opponent in the postseason for the first time since the 2009 N.L.D.S. against St. Louis.\n",

      "THE News IS: By Aaron Kesel\n",
      "A CIA whistleblower, Kevin Shipp, has emerged from the wolves den to expose the deep state and the shadow government which he calls two entirely separate entities.\n",
      "“The shadow government controls the deep state and manipulates our elected government behind the scenes,” Shipp warned in a recent talk at a Geoengineeringwatch.org conference.\n",
      "Shipp had a series of slides explaining how the deep state and shadow government functions as well as the horrific crimes they are committing against U.S. citizens.\n",
      "Some of the revelations the former CIA anti-terrorism counter intelligence officer revealed included that “Google Earth was set up through the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and InQtel.” Indeed he is correct, the CIA and NGA owned the company Google acquired, Keyhole Inc., paying an undisclosed sum for the company to turn its tech into what we now know as Google Earth. Another curious investor in Keyhole Inc. was none other than the venture capital firm In-Q-Tel run by the CIA according to a press release at the time.\n",
      "Shipp also disclosed that the agency known as the Joint Special Ops Command (JSOC) is the “president’s secret army” which he can use for secret assassinations, overturning governments and things the American people don’t know about.\n",
      "FBI warrantless searches violate the Fourth Amendment with national security letters, which Shipp noted enables them to walk into your employer’s office and demand all your financial records and if he or she says anything about them being there they can put your supervisor in jail or drop a case against themselves using the “State’s Secret Privilege law.”\n",
      "“The top of the shadow government is the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency,” Shipp said.\n",
      "Shipp expressed that the CIA was created through the Council on Foreign relations with no congressional approval, and historically the CFR is also tied into the mainstream media (MSM.) He elaborated that the CIA was the “central node” of the shadow government and controlled all of other 16 intelligence agencies despite the existence of the DNI. The agency also controls defense and intelligence contractors, can manipulate the president and political decisions, has the power to start wars, torture, initiate coups, and commit false flag attacks he said.\n",
      "As Shipp stated, the CIA was created through executive order by then President Harry Truman by the signing of the National Security Act of\n",
      "According to Shipp, the deep state is comprised of the military industrial complex, intelligence contractors, defense contractors, MIC lobbyist, Wall St (offshore accounts), Federal Reserve, IMF/World Bank, Treasury, Foreign lobbyists, and Central Banks.\n",
      "In the shocking, explosive presentation, Shipp went on to express that there are “over 10,000 secret sites in the U.S.” that formed after 9/11. There are “1,291 secret government agencies, 1,931 large private corporations and over 4,800,000 Americans that he knows of who have a secrecy clearance, and 854,000 who have Top Secret clearance, explaining they signed their lives away bound by an agreement.\n",
      "He also detailed how Congress is owned by the Military Industrial Complex through the Congressional Armed Services Committee (48 senior members of Congress) giving those members money in return for a vote on the spending bill for the military and intelligence budget.\n",
      "He even touched on what he called the “secret intelligence industrial complex,” which he called the center of the shadow government including the CIA, NSA, NRO, and NGA.\n",
      "Shipp further stated that around the “secret intelligence industrial complex” you have the big five conglomerate of intelligence contractors – Leidos Holdings, CSRA, CACI, SAIC, and Booz Allen Hamilton. He noted that the work they do is “top secret and unreported.”\n",
      "The whistleblower remarked that these intelligence contractors are accountable to no one including Congress, echoing the words of Senator Daniel Inouye when he himself blew the whistle on the shadow government during the Iran-Contra hearings in 1987.\n",
      "At the time Inouye expressed that the “shadow government had its own funding mechanism, shadowy Navy, and Air Force freedom to pursue its own goals free from all checks and balances and free from the law itself.”\n",
      "Shipp further added that the shadow government and elected government were in the midst of a visible cold war.\n",
      "So who is Shipp and is he credible as a whistleblower, does he have credentials for the CIA? Aim.org wrote:\n",
      "Shipp held several high-level positions in the CIA. He was assigned as a protective agent for the Director of Central Intelligence, a counterintelligence investigator, a Counter Terrorism Center officer, a team leader protecting sensitive CIA assets from assassination, a manager of high-risk protective operations, a lead instructor for members of allied governments, an internal staff security investigator, and a polygraph examiner. He was tasked with protecting the CIA from foreign agent penetration and the chief of training for the CIA federal police force. Mr. Shipp functioned as program manager for the Department of State, Diplomatic Security, and Anti Terrorism Assistance global police training program. He is the recipient of two CIA Meritorious Unit Citations, three Exceptional Performance Awards and a Medallion for overseas covert operations. He is the author of From the Company of Shadows–CIA Operations and the War on Terrorism.\n",
      "Shipp noted he was working with former NSA whistleblower William Binney but didn’t state what the two were working on together. Shipp is highly credible and may just be the highest level whistleblower. This leak is huge. He has been previously mentioned in the New York Times for blowing the whistle on the mistreatment of him and his family when they were put in a mold-contaminated home. He is also mentioned in a WikiLeaks cable during the GiFiles that I was able to dig up. Is this the beginning of whistleblowers coming forward to end the shadow government and deep state? You can watch Shipp’s full explosive presentation below.\n",

      "THE News IS: HONG KONG (Reuters) - A nearly 900-year-old porcelain Song dynasty bowl smashed the world auction record for Chinese ceramics on Tuesday, selling for HK$294.3 million ($37.68 million) at a Sotheby’s sale in Hong Kong.\n",
      "The small, blue-green item broke the previous record, also set in a sale in Hong Kong, when a 500-year-old imperial “chicken” cup from the Ming dynasty Chenghua period sold for HK$281.2 million ($36.0 million) in 2014, Sotheby’s said.\n",
      "The 13-cm (5-inch) bowl, used to wash brushes, was fired in the famed Northern Song dynasty (960-1127) kilns in Ruzhou, and was sold to an anonymous buyer after a 20-minute bidding battle.\n",
      "Such “Ru guanyao” wares -- known for their intense blue-green glaze and “ice-crackle” pattern -- are extremely rare because the kiln in China’s central Henan province had a brief production run of only around two decades.\n",
      "The bowl, from the Chang Foundation in Taiwan’s Hongxi Museum, is one of only four known pieces of Ru heirlooms in private hands. Since 1940, no more than six Ru vessels have ever appeared at auction, according to ceramics expert Regina Krahl.\n",
      "“We’ve had in last 20 years a huge sort of influx of mainland Chinese buyers. We’re filling the room with new prices, new interest and that’s what’s really driven the price today,” said Sotheby’s Asia deputy chairman Nicolas Chow, who declined to reveal the nationality of the buyer.\n",

      "THE News IS: The logo of Mexico's state-owned company Pemex is pictured at a refinery in Cadereyta, on the outskirts of Monterrey, Mexico, April 20, 2017. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril\n",
      "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Two foreign oil companies on Wednesday won the rights to partner with Mexico’s oil company Pemex on two onshore blocks, a first since landmark energy reform, while a third offshore area received no bids.\n",
      "The auction was run by the National Hydrocarbons Commission, the industry regulator, and marks only the second time partnership rights for Pemex projects have been made available.\n",
      "Egypt’s Cheiron Holdings Limited and Germany’s DEA Deutsche Erdoel won the rights to partner with Petróleos Mexicanos, commonly known as Pemex, on its Cardenas-Mora and Ogarrio blocks, respectively, which officials touted as a way to quickly boost production via new investment.\n",
      "“This underscores the beauty of the energy reform,” said Pemex Chief Executive Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya shortly after the auction.\n",
      "“Before, we would have to invest everything and now we only have to pay half and we receive a payment to be able to meet those costs,” he said.\n",
      "Mexico’s 2013 constitutional reform ended Pemex’s decades-long production monopoly. It also allowed the company to enter into joint ventures with equity partners for the first time in a bid to help reverse more than a dozen years of declining output.\n",
      "The onshore Cardenas-Mora area, a 65-square-mile (168 sq km) block in southern Tabasco state is believed to contain some 93 million barrels of mostly light crude. Pemex will receive a $125 million payment from Cheiron reflecting the company’s past investments in the area, Pemex said in a statement.\n",
      "Cheiron also agreed to pay Pemex another $41 million on top of the 13 percent additional royalty it bid for the partnerships rights, Pemex said.\n",
      "The Cardenas-Mora project is seen requiring a total of $1.1 billion to successfully develop over the life of the contract, while the Ogarrio project is seen requiring some $490 million, according to Pemex estimates.\n",
      "“We’re extremely happy, and we’re looking forward to this opportunity,” said Shady Kabel, Cheiron’s country manager for Mexico.\n",
      "In the case of the Ogarrio area, a 60-square mile (156 sq km) field also in Tabasco estimated to contain 54 million barrels in mostly light crude, Pemex will receive $190 million from DEA Deutsche, Pemex said in a statement.\n",
      "The German company also offered to pay a record-setting $213.9 million for the partnership rights on top of the 13 percent additional royalty, a sum that will be divided between Pemex and the government’s petroleum fund, said Martin Alvarez, an official at the National Hydrocarbons Commission.\n",
      "A third joint venture for the shallow water Ayin-Batsil block received no bids, which Gonzalez Anaya attributed to the complexity of the project.\n",
      "He also said Pemex would review the $250 million that Pemex calculated as its past investment in the area, a figure a potential partner would have had to reimburse and might have curtailed interest in the project.\n",
      "Both Cheiron and DEA Deutsche will operate the projects under license contracts with a 50 percent stake while Pemex will retain the remaining half.\n",
      "Pemex’s chief executive said he expected Ogarrio’s oil output to reach as much as 14,000 barrels per day (bpd) from about 10,000 bpd currently over the next year, while Cardenas-Mora’s production should increase to 14,000 bpd by 2020 from about 10,000 bpd.\n",

      "THE News IS: (Reuters) - You have seen his “Sunflowers” in a museum, sung along with Don McLean to “Vincent (Starry Starry Night)” and gawped at the tens of million of dollars his works have fetched at auction.\n",
      "But you have never seen Vincent Van Gogh’s art quite like it is shown in the film “Loving Vincent.”\n",
      "Seven years in the making and billed as the world’s first fully-painted feature film, “Loving Vincent” uses more than 130 of the Dutch artist’s own paintings to tell his own story.\n",
      "Each of the 65,000 frames of the animated independent film, created by Polish artist and animator Dorota Kobiela, is an oil painting hand painted by 125 professional artists who traveled from around the world to be a part of the project.\n",
      "“It looks like something completely different, and that doesn’t happen very often in our media-saturated world,” said Hugh Welchman, who co-wrote and directed the film with Kobiela.\n",
      "“Loving Vincent,” showing in limited release in New York and Los Angeles and arriving in Europe in October, was first filmed with actors playing some of the people Van Gogh captured on canvas.\n",
      "They include Saiorse Ronan as doctor’s daughter Marguerite Gachet and Chris O‘Dowd as postman Joseph Roulin, who walk through and inhabit his paintings as his story unfolds.\n",
      "Then came the hard part. Finding and training the painters to reproduce Van Gogh’s work.\n",
      "FILE PHOTO: Visitors take pictures with their mobile phone of the painting \"Portrait de l'Artiste, 1889\" (Self-Portrait) by artist Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, France, July 28, 2015. REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\n",
      "More than 4,000 artists from around the world applied for the job and 125 were chosen and put through three weeks training.\n",
      "“Even though we were hiring the very best oil painters, Vincent’s style look like it should be very easy but actually it’s difficult to do well,” said Welchman.\n",
      "“Even after training there were still quite a few painters who really found it impossible to get to grips with his style,” Welchman said.\n",
      "The $5.5 million production focuses on the last weeks of Van Gogh’s life before his death in 1890 in France at age 37 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n",
      "Welchman said the film has triggered some unusual responses.\n",
      "“We’ve had a lot of people in tears at screenings. People are sending poems or making cakes with intricate Vincent paintings on the cake,” he said.\n",
      "He and Kobiela hope the film encourages audiences to discover more about Van Gogh.\n",
      "“I’d like them to think there is more to his story than he went mad, cut off his ears, was a genius and did these incredibly colorful paintings that sell for lots of money.”\n",

      "THE News IS: “The future of ballet is really in the hands of the creators,” Mr. Peck said, “so if it’s something that interests them to push the envelope with gender roles, then I think it will change. But if that’s not of interest to a dance-maker, if their interest is to sort of preserve the way things have been done for the past 200 years, then nothing is going to change.”\n",
      "For the dancers, the roles feel like opportunities to express themselves in more nuanced ways. “I think for gay ballet dancers, you rarely get to be yourself,” Mr. Stanley said. Mr. Chamblee, his partner in “Not Our Fate,” and Daniel Applebaum, his partner in “Times Are Racing,” are also gay. Mr. Peck and Ms. Lovette are straight.\n",
      "Mr. Peck has been struck by the way Mr. Stanley and Mr. Applebaum have changed the tone of his pas de deux. “Somehow it feels more romantic to me,” Mr. Peck said. “At one of the early rehearsals, Daniel said, ‘It’s so nice to get to step into a role where I feel I could actually potentially fall in love with the person I’m dancing with, as opposed to pretending to be a prince falling in love with a princess.’”\n",
      "Robert La Fosse, a former choreographer who danced with both City Ballet and American Ballet Theater, has been active on Mr. Ratmansky’s Facebook feed. In an interview Mr. La Fosse said: “It’s very interesting that we’re looking at it now. And it’s good. It’s a conversation, and I think Justin and Lauren are wrestling with it: How do we become current?”\n",
      "For his pas de deux, Mr. Peck has made small tweaks so that each dancer takes a turn leading the other; learning how to be the supported one has been an adjustment for both. “There’s a constant exchange of who’s leading and who’s in charge,” Mr. Applebaum said. “So you have to switch on a dime.”\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "At one point in the ballet, Mr. Applebaum takes Mr. Stanley’s hand and they walk to the back of the stage. “I am holding his hand onstage because he’s offering it to me,” Mr. Stanley said. “I take it, and that just fills me so much in so many ways.”\n",
      "Mr. Applebaum said: “It’s bigger than that performance. It’s bigger than the two of us.”\n",
      "Mr. Stanley said he had similar emotional moments while working on Ms. Lovette’s ballet, which explores not only a same-sex relationship, but also issues of race, both in casting and in theme. “It’s not like we’re pushing boundaries,” Mr. Stanley said, “it’s just that things are sort of looking how they should be looking.”\n",
      "Originally, Ms. Lovette cast Mr. Stanley in her ballet because the women she was considering for the role were all taken. “I wanted to find a dancer that had a very liquid quality — a strength but also a dramatic side and a contemporary feel and I wasn’t finding it,” she said. “Then I thought Taylor has that. That’s exactly Taylor. Why can’t I put two guys together?”\n",
      "The effect, she said, blew her away. “Suddenly, they could just be themselves.”\n"

      "The 50-minute ride will be held at noon Saturday, Oct. 7 at CycleBar Westgate West with CycleStar instructor Pegah Olfat.\n",
      "Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a genetic bone disorder characterized by fragile bones that break easily. It is also known as “brittle bone disease.” The term literally means “bone that is imperfectly made from the beginning of life.” A person is born with this disorder and is affected throughout his or her lifetime.\n",
      "Pegah is also the sponsor of the ride. Her best friend’s daughter Isla was diagnosed with Type V OI in July. There are eight types of OI and Type V is the rarest.\n",
      "“Because there are fewer than 20,000 US cases per year, this disease is considered very rare,” said Olfat. “Please Ride for Isla and your donations will go to further research for Osteogensis Imperfecta!”\n",

      " \n",
      "Crucifixion remains one of the strangest ways of execution, and historically notorious thanks to the fact that there has not been any physical evidence of it found following the death of Jesus. in fact the only description of it has in fact been that found in art and literature, so were was physical evidence? Been that found in art and literature, so were was physical evidence?\n",

      "First Real Evidence Of Crucifixion Found In 1968\n",
      " \n",
      "The first real evidence was found in 1968 when archaeologists found a box made of stone that was hidden away in a tomb in northeast Jerusalem. Inside the box, there were a Jewish man’s remains and he was called Yehohanan. However, what astounded those who found the remains was that the heel bone seemed to have had a rather thick nail driven through it. This might have been evidence that Yehohanan had been crucified. Right now the only evidence that is physical which might relate to crucifixion is a single heel bone. Another thing that was strange about the finding of the body was that the box also contained a young boy’s body.\n",
      " \n",
      "If the man had been crucified, then everything that researchers thought they knew about crucifixion is wrong. Also, in a lot of ways, the discovery of the body of the man has brought with it more questions than it has answers.\n",

      "Vassilios Tzaferis excavated some Jewish tombs in1968, and the tombs were said to be from the 1st century CE and were in the northeast of Jerusalem. He found a stone box which contained bones, and it would go on to become one of the most significant of discoveries to have ever been made. On the boxes outside there was an inscription that said the body was Yehohanan, the son of Hagkol. It was thought that it had been in reference to the full name and the family line of the man, but later on, it was found that the inscription meant something that was a great deal more tragic about the box and its contents.\n",
      " \n",
      "When researchers looked deeper, they could not find a record of the name Hagkol, and in fact, they found out that the word meant crucified. This then suggested that the inscription on the box referred to the remains of a boy, who was the son of the crucified one, who had also been found in the box as both were buried together.\n",
      " \n",
      "Nail Through Heel Bone Had Traces Of Olive Tree Wood On It\n",
      " \n",
      "The archaeologists found what has been said to be the first real evidence of crucifixion in the box, the heel bone, which still had the nail in it that is said to have been used to nail the body onto the cross. Researchers studied the nail, and they found that it had traces of wood from an olive tree on it and the nail had been bent while it had been hammered into the tree. More significant was that it told researchers about the method of the crucifixion. The nails had not been put into the palms of the hands as there were no wounds on the bones of the hands of the man. It was thought that the feet of the man had been nailed through the heels onto the sides of the supporting beam.\n",
      " \n",
      "Along with the finding that the heels of the man had been nailed to the sides of the cross, it was also found out that criminals who had been crucified had their wrists bound to the top of the beam that ran horizontally. If they tried to put the nails through the hands to support the weight of a body, this would have been an impossible task. So it seems that the descriptions in the Bible and the paintings we have seen showing this were wrong and Jesus would not have been crucified in this manner.\n",

      "THE News IS: “Turtles All the Way Down,” published on Tuesday, Oct. 10, is Mr. Green’s most personal book yet. Its narrator, Aza Holmes, is a 16-year-old girl in Indianapolis who wrestles with anxiety and obsessive thought spirals. Aza has normal teenage preoccupations, and struggles to navigate the rites of adolescence: dating, fretting about college, calming her overbearing mother, appeasing her demanding best friend.\n",
      "But she is also frequently overcome by extreme dread. She’s certain that she’s contracted an intestinal bacteria that can be fatal. She worries that a cut on her finger, which she presses on uncontrollably, will become infected and kill her. She starts drinking hand sanitizer. She often wonders if she is fictional: If she can’t direct her own thoughts, who is really in control?\n",
      "“Turtles All the Way Down” is an emotionally fraught project for Mr. Green, whose young adult novels are beloved for their quirky humor and sharp, sensitive teenage protagonists. His books have more than 50 million copies in print worldwide; two have been adapted into films. Mr. Green, 40, who lives in Indianapolis with his wife, Sarah Urist Green, and their two children, Henry, 7, and Alice, 4, is one of the publishing industry’s biggest stars, and over the past decade, he and his brother Hank have built an online video business with 16 educational shows that have collectively drawn more than two billion views on YouTube.\n",
      "Mr. Green’s onscreen persona for YouTube shows like “Crash Course” is ceaselessly energetic and positive. But he has wrestled with weighty subjects in his books — his young characters battle illness and mortality, depression and bullying — and has occasionally addressed his own mental health issues. In a video posted this summer, he discussed how difficult it is to talk about his experience of obsessive compulsive disorder, in part because language so often fails to capture abstract feelings.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "With “Turtles All the Way Down,” Mr. Green tried to bridge the language barrier by bringing readers inside Aza’s consciousness, subjecting them to her anguished obsessions. Now, with the book’s release, he’s speaking to fans and interviewers about something deeply painful and personal.\n",
      "“I want to talk about it, and not feel any embarrassment or shame,” he said, “because I think it’s important for people to hear from adults who have good fulfilling lives and manage chronic mental illness as part of those good fulfilling lives.”\n",
      "On Monday, Mr. Green started his book tour with an event in Manhattan, where more than 100 fans gathered to see him and his brother put on a variety show of sorts. Mr. Green apologized for the slapdash quality of the performance — it was a rehearsal — then read passages from his novel that describe Aza’s debilitating fear about the wound on her finger. He told the audience that her crushing anxiety paralleled his own experience.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "“I spent a lot of my childhood consumed with obsessive worry and dread,” he said, adding that he hoped the novel would “help people who struggle with that terror to feel less alone.”\n",

      "Mr. Green was about 6 years old when he first became aware of his obsessive thought patterns. He was often afraid that his food was contaminated, and would only eat certain foods at particular times of day.\n",
      "As he got older, he was able to keep his anxiety in check, with the right mix of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy. But every once in a while, uncontrollable thoughts can overwhelm him.\n",
      "It happened once when he was 24, living in Chicago and working as a book reviewer for Booklist. He was so depressed he couldn’t eat, so he drank a couple of two-liter bottles of Sprite a day. Sometimes he couldn’t get up from his kitchen floor, where he lay staring at the bubbles in the soda bottle. He couldn’t read the books he was supposed to review because he couldn’t parse the words on the page.\n",
      "He went to stay with his parents, saw a psychiatrist and found the right medication. He returned to Chicago, where he began writing what would become his debut novel, “Looking for Alaska,” a semiautobiographical novel about a boarding-school student who is bullied. He sold it to Dutton for a tiny advance, and went on to publish several more acclaimed young adult novels, including “Paper Towns” and “The Fault in Our Stars,” the story of two teenagers with cancer who fall in love, which became a global best seller. Sudden fame was unsettling. Mr. Green, anxious about touching strangers, found himself at events, confronting crowds of fans, some of whom wanted to hug him and take photographs.\n",
      "Writing provided some relief, though he is careful to separate his creativity from his illness. At his sickest, he’s unable to think coherently enough to write.\n",
      "“For me, it’s a way out of myself, to not feel stuck inside myself,” he said, adding, “I want to be super careful not to claim there’s some huge benefit to this brain problem that I have.”\n",
      "In 2015, Mr. Green again suffered a severe onset of anxiety. It had been three years since he published “The Fault in Our Stars,” which became a megaseller, with more than 23 million copies in print worldwide, and was adapted into a feature film. Following up a success on that scale felt impossible. Mr. Green started and abandoned several novels. He worried he might never write another book.\n",
      "Then, hoping to jump-start his creativity, he went off his medication. He plummeted. “I can’t think straight — I can only think in swirls and scribbles,” he wrote about the experience.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "When he recovered in late 2015, he started writing the new novel, and finished a draft. He spent another year revising it with the help of his longtime editor, Julie Strauss-Gabel, who called the novel an “unbelievable act of translation” that gives readers a glimpse of what it’s like to suffer from mental illness. “He has worked really hard as a human being to figure that out,” Ms. Strauss-Gabel said.\n",
      "Hank Green said that when he first read the novel, he felt like he understood for the first time what it must feel like to live with obsessive compulsive disorder: “Even having a brother who deals with OCD, I never really got it until I read the book.”\n",
      "In the book’s acknowledgments, Mr. Green thanks his doctors and notes how fortunate he is to have a supportive family and mental health care that many don’t have access to.\n",
      "“It’s not a mountain that you climb or a hurdle that you jump, it’s something that you live with in an ongoing way,” he said. “People want that narrative of illness being in the past tense. But a lot of the time, it isn’t.”\n",

      "MOSCOW (Reuters) - The head of Russia’s central election commission urged President Vladimir Putin on Monday to ensure all investigations into election violations detected in Russia last month were completed, and the Kremlin leader promised to do so.\n",
      "Russia voted in local elections in many regions on Sept. 10 in what was widely seen as a dress rehearsal for next year’s presidential vote, with Kremlin-backed candidates for regional parliaments and governorships performing strongly.\n",
      "Putin is the strong favorite to win re-election in March, although he has so far declined to say if he will run.\n",
      "On Sept. 10, Reuters reporters observed the vote at six polling stations. In all six, they found discrepancies, of varying sizes, between the official vote tally and the number of voters the reporters counted.\n",
      "“We have practically tied up many ‘loose ends’ of that campaign, but small ‘ends’ still remain,” Russian media quoted Ella Pamfilova, head of the central election commission, as telling Putin at a meeting in the Kremlin.\n",
      "“I really would like our prosecutor general’s office and the investigative committee to bring the matter to completion in a number of cases,” she said, referring to inquiries into local election violations.\n",
      "She did not elaborate.\n",
      "“All orders will be given regarding this issue,” Putin replied.\n",

      "Scientists have discovered six more bursts of radio signals coming from somewhere deep in space outside our galaxy, from where similar signals were detected earlier last year and in 2017. From this specific location, a total of 17 radio signals were received, and because of its nature, there is also strong speculation as to whether we are being \"contacted\" by some form of extraterrestrial life form.\n",

The radio telescope scanned the sky as the earth spun. The signal was a constant source of radio waves, coincidence or not, speculate many, may be exactly the kind of signal an advanced civilization of extraterrestrials would send, because such a wave would stand out from the radio waves coming from space. The computer registered the signal as a sequence of six letters and numbers that lasted 72 seconds. Next to the sign Ehman wrote \"Wow!\", Thus becoming known\n",

      "TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS: RUNNIN’ DOWN A DREAM (2008) on Netflix, Amazon, and Youtube. Tom Petty, the celebrated rocker, died last week soon after wrapping up a joyous 40th anniversary tour with his indefatigable band the Heartbreakers. “He and the Heartbreakers steered clear of elaborate showmanship to let their songs and their musicianship speak for themselves,” Jon Pareles wrote in his obituary. Peter Bogdanovich’s documentary, running a whopping 238 minutes, charts the course of the Heartbreakers from their youth in Gainesville, Fla. — where an 11-year-old Tom Petty met Elvis Presley — to their rise as an international phenomenon. Interviews with friends and collaborators, such as George Harrison, Eddie Vedder and Roger McGuinn are sprinkled throughout; of course, there’s plenty of wry insight from Mr. Petty himself.\n",

On “The Toy Box,” inventors and entrepreneurs competing for a deal with Mattel and Toys “R” Us bring their concepts to a panel of very discerning judges, ages 7 to 12. The adult mentors of last year’s first season are gone, leaving kids firmly in charge. (One of those is Noah Ritter, of “Apparently” viral fame and frequent “Ellen” appearances.) The pitches this week include singing stuffed animals, a robotic flower and a variation on the inescapable fidget spinner.\n",

      "THE News IS: What did you most connect with in the Marston story?\n",
      "There was this incredible love story at the origin of what Wonder Woman would come to be. The Marstons were psychologists, and they really thought that if you could change hearts and minds, you could change the world. Marston called Wonder Woman “psychological propaganda” to try to get young boys and men to respect powerful women and find their power attractive. And he had this notion that if women ran the world, the world would be a better place.\n",
      "Video\n",
      "The Wonder Woman aspect of the story seems an easy sell. But the kink and the three-way relationship less so. Did you think you would have trouble getting this made?\n",
      "I spent many a night arguing with myself, being like, “Why are you even bothering to work on this because it will never see the light of day.” But I became obsessed with telling it, whether or not it would come to fruition, because I became enchanted with the characters and the process of writing it. I really wanted to tell a very organic love story without any editorializing or winking. I didn’t want to otherize the experience of what they were doing. I made the decision, very overtly, to tell the story using the conventions of a classic prestige biopic. I thought the content in and of itself was so potentially controversial that I wanted to just treat their lives the way you would treat anybody else’s life. I feel that kink is often portrayed in the movies as scandalous and dark or transgressive. But in their case, I didn’t think it was. In the film, it’s linked to this notion of fantasy versus reality. In this fantastical world, which ultimately leads to Wonder Woman, they can be their truest version of themselves.\n",
      "Frequently female filmmakers will make one independent film and not make another for years, if at all, while men may make an indie and then be given a franchise. As a black lesbian director, you made the short film “D.E.B.S,” got studio money to make a feature of it, then got to helm a movie in Disney’s “Herbie” franchise the next year. How did you defy the odds?\n",
      "Nina Jacobson was running Disney, and she was an amazing mentor to me, and I don’t know if I would have gotten that job if Nina wasn’t running the studio at that point. But she loved “D.E.B.S.” and was a really big supporter of mine and gave me the job.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "“Professor Marston and the Wonder Women” is your first feature since “Herbie” in 2005, although you frequently work in television. Did you find it hard to get another movie off the ground in that time?\n",
      "It was less like I feel like I can’t get my movie made. It was more the stories I wanted to tell. After “Herbie,” I tried to set up a bunch of projects, and they always had strong female protagonists. I would sell them to studios, but I realized they were never going to make them. I think the actual executives wanted to, but the machinery of the industry was like, these kinds of movies with female leads flop.\n",
      "But I had worked as a writer of the first season of “The L Word” and [the series creator] Ilene Chaiken said, “Why don’t you come and direct a few episodes?” It was just fantastic because there were all these strong female roles in cable. It was just when the wind really started hitting the sails of this kind of cable television revolution. And I feel like I was, if not on the ground floor, on the second floor of that.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "How did you decide you wanted to make movies?\n",
      "I originally wanted to be a theater director. But I remember a long time ago I was marching in the gay pride parade in Manhattan. And around the same time the “Friends” episode with the lesbian moms had aired. I remember thinking how many people am I reaching walking down Fifth Avenue? Thirty million people saw a positive portrayal of lesbian moms through their friend Ross. And how much does that move the dial? So I became very interested in how pop culture can really move forward political progress.\n",

      "(The Sports Xchange) - The Boston Red Sox fired manager John Farrell on Wednesday, two days after his team was eliminated from the playoffs.\n",
      "Farrell, who managed the Red Sox since 2013, will not return for the 2018 season, president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski announcement. The team said a search for a new manager will begin immediately.\n",
      "Farrell, 55, was 432-378 (.533) in five seasons, leading the Red Sox to the World Series title in 2013. He was under contract through the end of the 2018 season.\n",
      "The Red Sox were eliminated from the playoffs on Monday, losing to the Houston Astros 5-4 in Game 4 of the American League Division Series.\n",
      "Boston finished 93-69 (.574) in 2017 to win its ninth AL East division title. The Red Sox had the third-best record in the American League, tied for fifth best in the majors.\n",
      "During his Red Sox tenure, Farrell’s teams won three division titles (2013, 2016, 2017). His 432 managerial wins and 810 games managed both rank sixth in club history, and he is the only manager ever to lead the Red Sox to consecutive division titles.\n",
      "Farrell’s first season in 2013 was highlighted by Boston’s eighth World Series championship.\n",
      "Farrell began his major league managerial career with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2011, leading the team to a 154-170 record over two seasons. In his seven full seasons as a manager, his clubs went 586-548 (.517).\n",
      "Farrell’s first professional coaching stint began with Boston in 2007 when he spent four seasons as pitching coach. Over that four-year span, the Red Sox had three postseason appearances (2007-09), including the 2007 World Series title.\n",

      "THE News IS: Why start with the culture industries? The Five elicit worries of total social control. Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.\n",
      "The entertainment industry is a good place to assess those claims because in different ways, the Five have spent years building platforms for the distribution of art, culture and media. Facebook runs the news; Google’s YouTube has videos and music; Microsoft’s Xbox has games; Amazon runs books, movies and TV (and, through its web-hosting service, AWS, hosts much else, including Netflix); and Apple has pretty much of the same, plus all those apps.\n",
      "Yet in entertainment, we also see the limits of their efforts to push into new territory. Though their technologies have altered nearly everything about how we buy and experience popular culture, the Five themselves have not been the greatest beneficiaries of the changes.\n",
      "They are pouring money into entertainment, but they have been cornered by nimbler start-ups like Netflix and Spotify. Amazon has struggled to make a hit show, while Apple’s plans for original TV are perpetually around the corner. (It has now struck a deal to revive “Amazing Stories,” the 1980s Steven Spielberg series; there’s no word on when it will air.) All of the Five have labored to create some killer position in the tumultuous new marketplaces their platforms have enabled.\n",
      "Several times in conversations with people in Hollywood, I heard the tech people referred to as “dumb money” — the sort of outsiders (in the past, they came from oil, then from finance) who parade through town looking to call the shots. One Hollywood executive who has worked often with tech companies told me: “I wouldn’t say we’ve looked at them with fear, no.”\n",
      "The Five’s struggles in entertainment, if they persist, suggest that they can be as clueless about the changes wrought by technology as the rest of us — that they do not quite understand, and haven’t yet begun to master, how to translate their technological power into wider cultural power.\n",

      "Not long ago, this story looked a lot more open-and-shut. With the iPod and iTunes, Apple acquired dominance over a music industry that was struggling to respond to the digital age. Amazon eclipsed Barnes & Noble as the biggest boogeyman of the indie bookstore; for years, it fought bruising battles with the publishing industry over sales contracts that publishers said were too onerous. Through YouTube, Google gained control over not just funny cat videos, but also the modern replacement for radio. (People watch a lot of music videos on YouTube.) And Facebook has become the world’s most popular source of news, a position that has consumed its leaders over much of the last year.\n",

      "There’s no doubt that technology has upended the economics of modern cultural businesses. In a recent polemic, “Move Fast and Break Things,” Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California (and a former rock band manager and movie producer), points out that musicians could once make a decent living off their royalty checks.\n",
      "Digital technology has now completely undercut that business. YouTube has made every song available online, and even though many artists are paid a cut of the ads placed on YouTube (the company said it paid out $1 billion last year), the money is nothing close to what artists got from selling records.\n",
      "Mr. Taplin sees what has happened in music as a harbinger for much of the rest of culture. “The rise of the digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries in our country,” he wrote.\n",
      "But there is another side to the story. As I’ve argued before, while musicians have had to find new sources of revenue, the rise of online subscriptions and a new consumer willingness to pay have led to an explosion of new cultural voices.\n",
      "Meanwhile, some earlier doomsaying has not come true: Indie bookstores and print books are making a comeback, while publishers are enjoying record profits. And the tech giants’ eagerness to create entertainment marketplaces has led to a bonanza for some artists. To compete for new members, Apple, Tidal and other streaming services are paying out lavish bonuses; Apple paid Chance the Rapper $500,000 for two weeks of exclusive access to his latest album.\n",
      "The tech-industry money train is making its biggest hauls in Hollywood. “There are so many new markets for talent and writers to go to, and the creators here love that,” said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. “Instead of having seven buyers for your idea, there are now more like 20 — and that makes everybody happy.”\n",
      "This story may sound puzzling. The tech giants are the most sophisticated media companies in the world, so why, after prying open their wallets, have they struggled to capture Hollywood?\n",
      "It’s because technology is not all that matters. The Five acquired their power by mastering the tech industry. They achieved dominance in a field that’s won with information, data and precision.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "But even though they now control valuable platforms, as they move to areas that require them to stretch their skills they are finding that they won’t be able to roll in and take over. Several people in Hollywood told me that many of the Five just didn’t seem to “get” the movie and TV business. They had brought Northern California’s tech ideas to Southern California’s entertainment party, and did not understand the value of imagination, talent and subjective inspiration.\n",
      "This myopia is part of a pattern that will repeat itself often in this series. You see it in how Facebook got caught off guard by how it was used during the election, or in YouTube’s surprise that some of its biggest stars were pushing hateful ideas on its platform.\n",
      "The tech giants have upended much of society, but even they have difficulty understanding and navigating the chaos of the new platforms they have built. It’s not quite clear, yet, that they have the future all wrapped up.\n",

      "World Cup qualifying: Slovenia v Scotland Venue: Stozice Stadium Date: Sunday, 8 October Kick-off: 17:00 BST Coverage: Listen on BBC Radio Scotland; live text commentary on the BBC Sport website\n",
      "Scotland keeper Craig Gordon says missing out on Euro 2008 a decade ago will spur him on as the team seek the win over Slovenia that would ensure a World Cup play-off.\n",
      "Gordon was part of Alex McLeish's side beaten by Italy at Hampden in 2007 and Scotland have not been at a major tournament since the 1998 World Cup.\n",
      "\"I thought there might be many more opportunities to come at that stage - but there haven't been,\" he said.\n",
      "\"It is a big moment to try and grasp.\"\n",
      "Media playback is not supported on this device It won't be easy, says Scotland's Gordon\n",
      "Scotland now know victory in Ljubljana on Sunday (17:00 BST kick-off) will guarantee them second place in Group F and, crucially, that they would be one of the eight best group runners-up.\n",
      "\"At 34, nearly 35, it is something that might not come again,\" added Celtic's Gordon.\n",
      "\"Hopefully we can all play as if it is our last opportunity and try and grab it.\"\n",
      "Chris Martin's 88th-minute winner against Slovenia sparked Scotland's resurgence\n",
      "A 1-0 win over Slovenia at Hampden in March, courtesy of a late Chris Martin goal, was the start of Scotland's five-game unbeaten run.\n",
      "\"That was a big moment in the group for us,\" acknowledged Gordon, who has kept a clean sheet in four of those games, including the past three.\n",
      "\"If that didn't happen and we only got a draw, we probably wouldn't be sitting here now and hoping to get a play-off place. That gave us a lot of confidence and we have gone on a good run from there.\n",
      "\"We are in a good place, especially after the start of the campaign. It is up to us now to try to get one more win. We have done well over the last four or five games to put ourselves in this position, and now we have to make that final jump and get the points to make sure we do it.\"\n",

      "'Confidence is as high as it possibly could be'\n",
      "Scotland kept their World Cup qualifying hopes alive in dramatic fashion on Thursday as a late Martin Skrtel own goal gave them victory over 10-man Slovakia at Hampden Park.\n",
      "Far from trying to shut out the excitement surrounding the national team's late surge to the brink of a play-off place, Gordon says the squad should relish it.\n",
      "\"We are actually happy we are in this situation we have got ourselves in - it is not something we should burden ourselves with,\" he added.\n",
      "\"It is great to be involved in this and have this opportunity. We have earned it. No matter how we started, we are finishing well.\n",
      "\"We are on a great run. Confidence is as high as it possibly could be.\"\n",
      "Slovenia, although virtually out of play-off contention, have not conceded a goal at home during qualifying and Scotland manager Gordon Strachan has said his side face a \"hard, hard job\".\n",
      "Gordon added: \"We are up against a good team and we have to pay attention to that. They have got dangerous players that can hurt us.\n",
      "\"We have still got a very big task. I think everybody is thinking it is maybe going to be easy, but it isn't.\n",
      "\"They have got one of the best goalkeepers in the world and a mean defence. We are going to have to really play well, create chances - and hopefully take one.\"\n",

      "THE News IS: Psoriasis: Why See a Specialist? By Allie Lemco Toren\n",
      "Was this helpful? ( 21 )\n",
      "Psoriasis is a complex disease that affects everyone differently. That’s why all psoriasis patients should follow unique treatment plans tailored to their specific needs. But your primary care doctor may not have all the information you need to manage your psoriasis successfully.\n",
      "That’s where specialists come in: a psoriasis specialist, called a dermatologist, has the right skills and insight to help you stay in control of your condition. Here’s why:\n",
      "1. A dermatologist completes extensive training in treating psoriasis and is an expert in psoriasis care.\n",
      "A dermatologist is a physician who specializes in treating diseases related to the skin, hair and nails. These parts of the body are involved in many aspects of human health, so dermatologists must train extensively to master this area of study. A dermatologist will have expertise in treating psoriasis and other conditions related to the skin, hair and nails.\n",
      "All doctors complete an internship after they finish medical school, where they have the opportunity to examine patients with skin problems. But dermatologists receive extensive training beyond that. Dermatologists spend three or more additional years in residency training, during which they train under experienced dermatologists and focus on patients with psoriasis and issues affecting the skin, hair and nails. At the end of this period, specialists can take an exam to become a board-certified dermatologist. Look for a doctor who is board certified in dermatology, and you’ll know you’re seeing an expert.\n",
      "2. A dermatologist never stops learning about psoriasis.\n",
      "To maintain their board certification, dermatologists must keep up with new developments in their field. They must complete continuing education and renew their license every few years, depending on the state in which they practice and other factors. By following these requirements, board-certified dermatologists stay on top of new treatments and discoveries about the mechanisms involved in psoriasis, so they can then provide their patients with insightful, informed, and up-to-date treatment plans.\n",
      "3. A dermatologist has extensive experience in treating psoriasis.\n",
      "Dermatologists see a higher volume and concentration of patients with psoriasis, and thus are more experienced in treating the condition successfully. Because they see lots of patients with psoriasis, they can add real-world knowledge of the disease to their academic and clinical training. They’re able to assess how well patients respond to certain treatments, have a deeper understanding of how psoriasis progresses over time, share insight about effectively implementing lifestyle changes, and recognize symptoms that a general practitioner may miss, among other skills.\n",
      "4. A dermatologist is a team player.\n",
      "Dermatologists work with teams of other health care providers who treat patients with psoriasis and can connect patients with nurse practitioners, nutritionists, mental health counselors, rheumatologists, and other experts in psoriasis management. Working with a team can help patients address all aspects of the disease and ensure success.\n",
      "5. It’s easy to find the right dermatologist for you.\n",

      "Wait, when did they put that giant metal rabbit under the Eiffel Tower?\n",
      "If you receive photos of the provocative artist Jeff Koons’s sculptures looming under and over international landmarks, don’t be alarmed: It’s just augmented reality. Snapchat has partnered with Mr. Koons to allow users to project his sculptures in specific sites around the world — including in Central Park in New York, the Sydney Opera House in Australia, and on the Champ de Mars in Paris.\n",
      "The project, part of Snapchat’s Lens feature that is available starting on Tuesday, lets users animate photos and videos — the app’s dancing hot dog, for instance, which used the technology, has become a viral sensation. Mr. Koons’s sculptures will be Snapchat’s first site-specific lenses, and will only be able to be activated within about 1,000 feet of a location.\n",
      "“The lenses are an example of the way Snapchat is trying to remove friction from the creative process,” Evan Spiegel, founder and chief executive of Snapchat, said at a news conference at Vanity Fair’s New Establishment Summit on Tuesday. “The fact we can bring these ginormous sculptures anywhere in the world is just the beginning of inspiring young people all over the world to create with our cameras.”\n",
      "Users would be able to take photos of themselves with famous Koons sculptures — like “Balloon Dog” (in front of which Jay-Z performed on a recent tour), “Rabbit” and “Play-Doh.” Some of their locations also include Millennium Park in Chicago, the National Mall in Washington, the Venice Boardwalk in Los Angeles, Hyde Park in London and Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro. The sculptures would appear to be about three stories tall.\n",
      "Over the last year, Mr. Koons has dabbled in designing handbags and snowboards; last year he created a special edition smartphone case for Google. He praised Snapchat in an interview with i-D this year: “I think it’s wonderful that people can, you know, pick up a phone and feel the freedom of — like Snapchat — making something that is aesthetically and emotionally pleasing, and fun, and to just feel that experience.”\n",

      "HONG KONG — Kim Jong-un has promoted his younger sister to North Korea’s most important political body, a rare public gesture of confidence by a leader whose dealings with family members are often opaque and sometimes deadly.\n",
      "The sister, Kim Yo-jong, who heads the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea’s propaganda department and is the only one of Mr. Kim’s siblings active in his government, was made an alternate member of the Politburo on Saturday. Her promotion was announced Sunday by the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency.\n",
      "Ms. Kim is believed to be 28 to 30 years old, which would make her the youngest member of the powerful but secretive decision-making body. Her promotion took place during a gathering of senior party members a day before the 20th anniversary of when the Kims’ father, Kim Jong-il, was named general secretary of the Workers’ Party.\n",
      "Ms. Kim is often seen accompanying her brother at state functions and on tours of military units and factories. Unlike senior generals and party secretaries who cluster around Mr. Kim taking notes, Ms. Kim often appears in state news photographs able to move about on her own.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "The siblings’ mother, Ko Yong-hui, was Kim Jong-il’s third wife. Ms. Kim’s bloodline gives her an unmatched status among the party’s elites. The state news media often shows top-ranking officials listening reverentially when she speaks.\n",

      "THE News IS: The logo of commodities trader Glencore is pictured in front of the company's headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, July 18, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n",
      "LONDON (Reuters) - Commodities trader and miner Glencore has swooped in to replace China’s Sinopec as the buyer of Chevron’s South African and Botswana assets after reaching a deal with local investors.\n",
      "The assets include a 100,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban as well as 820 petrol stations and other oil storage facilities. It also includes 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana.\n",
      "In its statement on Friday, Glencore said it had agreed to buy Chevron’s 75 percent stake in its South African subsidiary and its Botswana interests for a combined $973 million. The remaining 25 percent stake will stay with a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust.\n",
      "An industry source familiar with Glencore’s mergers and acquisitions activities said the company was looking to bring in a partner.\n",
      "A spokesman for Chevron said the company does not comment on commercial matters. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "Glencore stepped in after local shareholders exercised pre-emption rights following delays to the Sinopec deal.\n",
      "In March, Chevron announced that it had agreed the sale of its assets to China’s largest refiner Sinopec, for nearly $1 billion. As of May, the deal had been under review by South Africa’s Economic Development ministry.\n",
      "Glencore was among the bidders for the stake last year along with oil major Total and rival trading house Gunvor.\n",
      "END OF ERA\n",
      "The stake was of keen interest to many oil traders as the retail network is one of the biggest in South Africa and it provides access to strategic storage in Saldanha Bay on the southwestern coast.\n",
      "Chevron along with other oil majors have announced a flurry of downstream sales in the last few years to trim costs after global oil prices slumped in 2014.\n",
      "Chevron, which has had a presence in South Africa for more than a century, announced the sale in January 2016.\n",
      "Nimbler oil trading firms have snapped up the unwanted oil refineries and retail stations particularly in industrializing nations such as South Africa where young populations and a fast-growing middle class are expected to boost fuel demand.\n",
      "Glencore has shifted in the last year from shedding interests during the 2015-2016 commodities downturn to asset-buying since the rebound in prices.\n",
      "The deal, which will include Glencore retaining Chevron’s local management team and workforce, will be funded using existing cash resources and is expected to close in mid-2018.\n",
      "“Glencore intends to manage its overall oil asset portfolio to ensure that, including this transaction, net additional capital investment is limited to less than $500 million over the next 12 months,” it said.\n",

      "As Halloween approaches, dark, violent shows like “Mr. Robot” and “Riverdale” return for new seasons. And a Halloween classic comes to Netflix.\n",
      "What’s on TV\n",
      "MR. ROBOT 10 p.m. on USA. Elliot Alderson has had two rough seasons. The hacker, played by Rami Malek, has battled anxiety, a prison stint, drug addictions and sinister corporations. But in the third season, which starts Wednesday night, he tries to turn over a new leaf, with some help from his friend Angela (Portia Doubleday). “He’s become a more conscious, responsible human being who is looking to right the wrongs that he’s made and grown into more of a man,” Mr. Malek told The New York Times last week.\n",

      "RIVERDALE, 8 p.m. on the CW. “Twin Peaks” meets “Gossip Girl”? Welcome to the world of “Riverdale,” an adaptation of the Archie comics that imbues its teen-show tropes with a moody, noir edge. (“The terrific art direction warps the bubble-gum iconography into something haunting and lurid,” James Poniewozik wrote in his review in The Times.) While the first season’s central question — who killed Jason Blossom? — was solved, a host of disturbing new mysteries have materialized. The first episode of the second season, “A Kiss Before Dying,” follows Archie as he drags his wounded father to the hospital and speculates over who attacked him.\n",
      "FRONTLINE: WAR ON THE EPA 10 p.m. on PBS, check local listings. As Oklahoma’s attorney general, Scott Pruitt fought the Environmental Protection Agency for years. Now he runs the agency, and on Monday he announced his intention to repeal President Obama’s signature policy to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. This documentary traces the rise of Mr. Pruitt, his anti-regulatory movement, and the skepticism about science that pervades the country.\n",
      "What’s Streaming\n",
      "CHANCE on Hulu. Hugh Laurie playing an unstable, biting doctor isn’t a new idea. But “Chance,” Mr. Laurie’s show on Hulu, arguably goes into more sinister and deranged territory than “House” ever did. Mr. Laurie plays Eldon Chance, a neuropsychiatrist consultant who reads horrific patient reports but doesn’t do anything to affect the patients’ lives — until he becomes entangled with one and plunges into the seedy side of San Francisco. In Season 2, a detective coerces him into helping him take down a serial killer.\n",

      "DONNIE DARKO (2001) on Netflix, YouTube and Google Play. There are few Halloween movies better than “Donnie Darko,” which arrives on Netflix on Wednesday. A young Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie, a disturbed high schooler haunted by doomsday visions, bullies and a metallic rabbit giving him commands. “Mr. Gyllenhaal’s long, open face seems like a wound here; his every state of mind bleeds onto the screen,” Elvis Mitchell wrote in his review in The Times. The corkscrew narrative creeps along with sharp, acidic turns, splashes of foreshadowing and a sense of dread. The movie’s reality should be questioned; the anxious pounding of your heart should not.\n",

      "THE News IS: Absolutely. If you look for parallels, look at South Africa during 2010 — you experienced that first African World Cup, you feel that buzz. You land in Joburg or Cape Town and walk the streets and you feel that electricity. It’s the same thing over here: it’s the first World Cup in the Middle East. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and we’ve always focused on it being a regional World Cup. This is a World Cup beyond Qatar. It’s a cultural experience.\n",
      "Does the current situation in the region, the blockade of Qatar by some of its neighbors, complicate that idea of making it a regional event?\n",
      "No. We’ve always taken the simple position that sports is elevated from conflict. This is always a platform to bring people together, and to separate it from any political ideology.\n",
      "Do you think your neighbors will play along with that?\n",
      "I can’t speak on their behalf. From our side, we’ve always taken that position. Even today, from our side, everybody’s welcome. I hope that they see reason, and recognize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the people of our region. We’re football crazy. I mean, the Middle East, the Arab world, is football crazy, plain and simple. You go to any corner, whether it’s in Qatar, whether it’s in Saudi, whether it’s in Morocco, and start speaking football, and you will find a very, very deep caldron of passion and knowledge.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "The compact nature of Qatar’s World Cup means the stadiums will be only an hour or two apart at most, and sometimes much less. Are there plans to take advantage of that, and does that raise security issues?\n",
      "The compact World Cup has a lot of advantages, first and foremost for the fans. Whoever has experience previous World Cups, you always had to figure out ways of traveling, and accommodations, trying to follow your team, and it puts stress on fans. Here, the fans have the opportunity to attend more than one match a day.\n",
      "There is talk about taking advantage of that, right? Of selling multiday or multigame passes?\n",
      "That’s what I’m saying. You can watch a match in the afternoon and then go for the evening match as well. So it adds that element for fans who want to do that. And more importantly, for players. Because the players don’t have to worry about traveling from one place to another. They don’t have to worry about playing a match in a certain city, getting up early, getting on a flight, moving on, getting used to a new accommodation, resting, and then going out and playing. Everybody is focused on what matters: delivering to the best of their ability on the pitch. And that can only be good for the fans.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "And security concerns from having all those different fans so close to one another?\n",
      "You look at the Olympics, it has that Olympic Village feel, that global, international, we-are-a-global-community feel to it. And that’s what this World Cup offers as well. In terms of managing that, and security, we are in constant coordination and cooperation with major security operations throughout the world, learning from them, whether it’s in terms of Champions League matches or league matches. We’re present at every single major tournament.\n",
      "But mixing rival fans can lead to trouble, like the day when English and Russian fans fought in Marseille at the European Championships last year.\n",
      "I think it’d be very cynical and very pessimistic to look at certain examples and say, “This is the norm,” when sometimes they’re the outlier.\n",
      "Have you had feedback from FIFA, or from individual associations, about the idea that a team might be able to spend the whole tournament in one place?\n",
      "That was the essence of our bid, and for a lot of people it was appealing. What matters for us is to create an environment for the teams and the coaches. But I think it’s important to note that major international teams have come to Qatar to use it as the base for their winter camps — Barcelona, Real Madrid, Milan, Bayern Munich. And people come because we have got some of the best facilities in the world. State of the art. And that’s the reason they continue to come back.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "Qatar has taken tough criticism from human rights and labor groups over the treatment of workers, some of it quite severe. We’re interested in your thoughts on that.\n",

      "No country is perfect. We have issues, and we have challenges when it comes to being the fastest growing nation at a point in time in terms of both population and economic activity. Unfortunately, while the laws were in place, the ability and the resources to implement and enforce these laws were challenging. With the World Cup coming on board, of course the spotlight came in, but this is something we recognized. So when we said legacy, we mean the World Cup is an opportunity to be a catalyst for positive change, and to increase the momentum for initiatives that the government was already committed to. And of course worker welfare is one of them.\n",
      "There’s obviously what the government has done, which I can’t speak to with authority. What I can tell you is what we’ve done as the Supreme Committee. When we won the World Cup, we developed a charter, we assessed the market conditions, we looked at the gaps and the issues, we consulted with NGOs and the construction sector, to understand the challenges from their side, and we developed a set of standards.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "We are now in our second edition, and these standards are a live document, and they are constantly being reviewed. To ensure they’re being enforced, we’ve developed a four-tier auditing system: a self-audit by the contractors themselves; our own audits that we do; we’ve got a third-party auditor that conducts its own and issues its own annual report; and we’ve of course got the government auditing our projects as well.\n",
      "These issues that you’re referring to in the news media weren’t reflected on us, weren’t the World Cup project. There is only one report that came out, from Amnesty International, where they had performed an investigation, and then a year later they came to us and said: “These are our findings. What do you have to say about this?” During that year — we didn’t realize Amnesty International had performed that investigation — we identified these issues and were fixing them. So actually our system worked. Because as the projects started ramping up, we started identifying the areas and the gaps and so on, and we had addressed a lot of these issues.\n",
      "So if we called Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, they would say everything’s been fixed?\n",
      "They wouldn’t say everything’s been fixed because I’m not saying everything’s been fixed. What I’m saying is this is a work in progress. This is not something that can be fixed overnight. But you can definitely talk to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch and talk about our commitment, talk about our transparency with them, about the progress that we’ve made. And I would urge you to call them and ask them that question. On the other hand, when you call them, ask them if all the conditions in the United States were fixed. Then I’d be interested in you making a comparison on the answer.\n",
      "Because for me it’s very simple: the issue that we’re talking about, of worker welfare, is an issue that the global community faces. Every country in the world faces it.\n",
      "There are ways that a major international event like this might seem to clash with the culture of a Muslim country, so let me ask a couple specific questions. Will drinking alcohol be allowed in the stadiums and the hotels and the fan zones?\n",
      "We’ve always said it very clearly: alcohol will be allowed. But it won’t be allowed in public spaces. It’ll be allowed in certain designated areas, for example, but you won’t be allowed to walk the street drinking alcohol.\n",
      "Will gay fans be welcomed, and do they have anything to fear?\n",
      "It’s a simple thing: everyone is welcome to come to Qatar. What we ask is that when people come just to respect — we’re a relatively conservative nation. Public display of affection is something that’s not part of our culture. So all we ask is that every fan who comes in, and every fan is welcome, is we ask that people respect that.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "The last one is: should Israel qualify, would the team and its fans be welcome?\n",
      "Everyone is welcome. It’s a simple answer: everybody is welcome.\n",
      "How many visitors do you expect in 2022?\n",
      "Cumulatively, we’re talking about 1.2 million.\n",
      "Can Qatar handle that yet? How much of the infrastructure for that is in place already?\n",
      "It’s being developed. But this is the vision of the World Cup for us. When we first bid, the idea was simple: Utilizing this World Cup as an opportunity as a catalyst for the country’s growth, for its original urban development plans. So as the country was expanding, the infrastructure of the World Cup fit in with the country’s plans. We re-prioritized certain projects, obviously, to fulfill the World Cup requirements, but that’s just a milestone in the country’s overall development. So the hotels required for the country’s tourism requirements are being developed. The metro system is going to be functioning by 2020. The road networks are being developed as well. So by 2020, 2021, everything is going to be in place.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "How do you avoid the kind of waste that Brazil and South Africa experienced, these massive stadiums they don’t need after the tournament leaves?\n",
      "When we submitted the bid, that was the first thing in our mind: we wanted to avoid white elephants, a reminder of money that was spent and then not utilized.\n",
      "So take the stadiums: each stadium we’ve designed, we assured that it was on the transit network that was being developed for the country, and that each one had to be a center for the community, that each one had a legacy story already developed.\n",
      "We realized the FIFA requirements in terms of capacity didn’t fulfill our needs beyond 2022, so we developed the modular seating concept. We decided on the stadiums we would need, and these would have a mixture of fixed and modular seats. So the fixed seats would be the capacity we need – about 15,000 to 20,000 — and the rest would be taken out. Other stadiums, the entire concept is modular, so we’ll be taking the entire seating capacity out.\n",
      "How did we decide which would be temporary? We engaged the community. For every design, we went to them and asked, “What do you need? What are you missing? How can this facility assist you?” So, for example, down south is a small little city called Al Wakrah. We went to the community and asked them, “What do you need?” They turned around and said one of the things we need is wedding halls. “There’s a lot of these weddings, and we always go up to Doha — we need a wedding hall.” So within the project we developed an area for the wedding hall. There was a need for school facilities, so within the master plan we also have developed space for school facilities. Every single stadium has that kind of story, to be used as a center for its community.\n",
      "But that’s stadiums. In terms of infrastructure, the metro system, the road network, it’s part of the urban development of the country.\n",

      "Skinny jeans, snug waistbands and tight bra straps: items like these rub on the skin, triggering irritation and painful flare-ups. Instead, opt for relaxed-fit pants or skirts, flowy tops, and looser underwear. Women should still support their breasts, however, since skin that touches skin can also lead to acne inversa symptoms. Choose comfortable bras made out of moisture-wicking, breathable fabrics. And set up a proper bra fitting to make sure your band is not too tight. Many department and lingerie stores offer this service. Once you find the right bra, make sure you wash it once a week to get rid of oils and germs that may irritate your skin. It’s helpful to avoid laundry detergents with dyes and perfumes, as these chemicals may also aggravate the skin.\n",

      "THE News IS: For four nights beginning on Thursday night, a scientist in Alaska is attempting to create an artificial aurora that could perhaps be seen as far away as Yukon.\n",
      " \n",
      "The experiment is out of the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) Observatory at Gakona, Alaska, and is planned for 9:30 p.m.\n",
      " \n",
      "You Thought HAARP has been shut down? Nope!\n",

      "<img src=\"http://www.sciechimiche.org/scie_chimiche/images/stories/Haarp/haarp04.jpg\">\n",
      " \n",
      "The experiment is going to take place at 9.30pm, and it comes from the High-frequency Active Aurora Research Program Observatory which is in Gakona in Alaska. An artificial airglow in the sky is going to be created by assistant research professor Chris Fallen at the University of Alaska Fairbanks at the Geophysical Institute.\n",
      " \n",
      "Fallen said that sometimes the artificial airglow is called a radio-enhanced aurora or an artificial aurora. He went on to say that what it means is that radio waves from the ground that are powerful can make a glow in the sky. Fallen is going to look into which of the transmissions he makes produce the brightest artificial aurora. He said that the reason why some radio wave transmission causes a glow in the upper atmosphere that is the same colors as the natural aurora is something that is not well understood at the moment.\n",

      "What HAARP Is... And Everything Its Used For\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "The knowledge that comes from the experiment of Fallen might also help scientists to gather a better understanding of natural auroras. Fallen went on to say that the experiment should provide them with information on the communications between Earth and satellite and how they are affected by the ionosphere. Fallen believes that this is something that would be very important for navigation uses.\n",
      " \n",
      "The residents of Dawson City in Yukon and Whitehorse should get a good chance to take photographs providing the conditions are clear. Fallen said to the North the best chance of being able to spot the artificial aurora is by taking photographs as the glow from it might be too low for just the naked eye to pick up. Of course, the weather plays a big part in how successful the experiment is going to be. Fallen said that in the past observation has been hampered thanks to clouds and said that if the weather is not in his favor this time, he will postpone.\n",

      "He went on to say that the experiment is expensive to conduct as while in operation the facility goes through around 600 gallons of diesel every hour. Along with taking photographs, Fallen said that anyone with a shortwave radio would be able to hear the radio frequency that actually creates the aurora. It was said to be a sound much like that of a fax machine.\n",

      "THE News IS: “It’s sad that a manager, and even some players, are looked at differently because they don’t have a World Series or an N.B.A. championship behind their name,” said the Nationals’ bench coach, Chris Speier, who also worked with Baker in Chicago and Cincinnati. “I don’t feel that anybody should be judged because they haven’t done it. You look at their track record over all. Wherever he’s gone, he’s proven he’s a winner.”\n",
      "Baker stayed three more seasons with the Cubs after they lost the 2003 National League pennant to the Marlins, who infamously scored eight runs in the eighth inning of a Game 6 comeback in the N.L.C.S. A Cubs fan deflected a catchable foul ball, a shortstop made an error, a bunch of Marlins got hits — the warmed-over details are well-known here.\n",
      "But if Baker still felt connected to the Cubs, it did not show up in his rooting interest last fall. After the Nationals lost by one run to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the fifth game of their division series, Baker watched the World Series as a neutral observer. He had friends with both the Cleveland Indians and the Cubs.\n",
      "“I was neither rooting for them nor against them,” Baker said Sunday of the Cubs. “I was just rooting for a good game, because I didn’t have any skin in the game, and I’m not a gambler. I just wanted a good game, and that’s what we got; we got some good games.”\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "He continued: “Deep down inside, we were one out or one pitch away from that possibly being us. But you can’t live in the past.”\n",
      "Indeed, October heartbreak has stalked Baker’s teams since 2003. Before last October’s excruciating division series loss, his Reds lost in the same round in 2010 (Philadelphia’s Roy Halladay pitched a no-hitter in the opener) and in 2012, to the Giants, after winning the first two games on the road. The Reds replaced Baker after they lost the N.L. wild-card game in Pittsburgh the next season.\n",
      "The Nationals hired Baker before the 2016 season after negotiations with another candidate, Bud Black, collapsed. A team that had underachieved in its final season under Matt Williams coalesced around Baker.\n",

      "“The individuals on the team bought into the cohesiveness of the unit,” Speier said. “That’s something he’s always preached, because of his background of always having your brother’s back, no matter what. That’s been at the forefront ever since I’ve known him — you take yourself out of it and worry about your brother.”\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "In a way, Baker’s pursuit of a title mirrors his team’s. Washington has won a World Series before, and so has Baker, but both were much different then. The Washington team that won it was the Senators, a precursor to the Minnesota Twins, in 1925. When Baker won it, in 1981, he played left field for the Dodgers.\n",
      "This is Baker’s 14th trip to the postseason (four as a player, one as a coach, nine as a manager), and he does not change with the seasons.\n",
      "“Same as always — it’s Dusty,” said Max Scherzer, Washington’s Game 3 starter, who insists his sore right hamstring can withstand 100 pitches on Monday. “He’s always got a great story for you, somehow, some way. He keeps everybody loose, everybody laughing. Nothing’s really changed.”\n",
      "The Cubs had a light, optional workout on Sunday morning, with many players appearing on the field only to sample the breakfast arranged on the warning track behind the plate. Joe Maddon, the Cubs’ irreverent manager, has done this before in October, complete with an N.F.L. game on the video board. Maddon wore a Joe Namath jersey in the clubhouse, though he made no guarantees for his team.\n",
      "“We’re not there yet,” he said, smiling.\n",
      "The Nationals held an afternoon workout, with no food or football in sight. Everyone took batting practice or fielded balls in the outfield, just as they would in the regular season. The Cubs’ offbeat vibe is not Baker’s style.\n",
      "“It’s not my thing, really,” he said. “My thing is, No. 1, I’m an innovator of stuff. I don’t copy other people. Most of the time, they copy me. And No. 2, they can do what they want to do. I really don’t care, honestly. It seems to work for them, and our own thing seems to work for us.”\n",

      "THE News IS: For some of the players you should start in Week 6, read on. Then check out our Week 6 player rankings.\n",
      "Quarterback\n",
      "Deshaun Watson (HOU vs. Browns) — It has become evident that Watson is a must-start fantasy quarterback every week, so you won’t need me to tell you how great he is going forward. On average, Watson was the 23rd quarterback taken in fantasy drafts over the summer, as Tom Savage won the starting job heading into Week 1. That changed before Week 1’s game was even over. Since then, Watson is second only to Aaron Rodgers in the N.F.L. in touchdown passes (12), and is fantasy’s second-highest-scoring player at 22.5 fantasy points per game. In case you’re still not sold, he plays the Browns this week, a team averaging 20.0 F.P.P.G. to the position this season (fourth most).\n",
      "Jacoby Brissett (IND at Titans) — Should your starting quarterback be on a bye this week, consider Brissett, who topped 300 yards for the first time in his young career last week. He has been a top-10 fantasy quarterback in two of the last three weeks, including 27.8 fantasy points in Week 3 against the Browns. His next matchup is with the Titans, who are tied with the Patriots for the most passing touchdowns allowed this season (12) and allow the third most F.P.P.G. to quarterbacks.\n",
      "Also consider: Carson Palmer (ARI vs. Buccaneers); Jameis Winston (TB at Cardinals)\n",
      "Running Back\n",
      "C.J. Anderson (DEN vs. Giants) — The rumors of Anderson’s fantasy value imploding because of Jamaal Charles’s presence were highly exaggerated. Anderson has outsnapped Charles, 93-32, over the past two games, giving him a pretty firm grip on workhorse status. The Broncos will host the decimated Giants, and should be leading early in this one, meaning the run game should be leaned on throughout. The Giants allow 4.5 yards per carry and the 10th most F.P.P.G. (20.3) to the running back position.\n",
      "Jordan Howard (CHI at Ravens) — It’s difficult to trust anyone in this messy Bears offense, but Howard has some things in his favor in Week 6. He outcarried Tarik Cohen, 19-6, last week, and he has had at least 18 carries for the third game in a row. With the rookie Mitch Trubisky now behind center, the Bears should lean on Howard even more against the Ravens, who have given up the eighth most F.P.P.G. (20.5) to running backs this season.\n",
      "Also consider: Mike Gillislee (NE at Jets); Adrian Peterson (ARI vs. Buccaneers)\n",
      "Wide Receiver\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "T.Y. Hilton (IND at Titans) — He has been able to prove he can be a major fantasy asset even with Andrew Luck out, thanks to the emergence of Brissett as a somewhat stable option at quarterback. The last two times the Colts’ passing game has had a favorable matchup, both Brissett and Hilton have taken advantage. Hilton had a combined 14 catches for 330 yards in Week 3 (vs. Browns) and Week 5 (vs. 49ers). You have to like his chances against the Titans, who are allowing an average of roughly 250 receiving yards and 2.5 receiving touchdowns per game in 2017, and the fourth most F.P.P.G. (26.2) to the wide receiver position.\n",
      "Devin Funchess/Kelvin Benjamin (CAR vs. Eagles) — With Cam Newton back to being the Cam Newton who isn’t horrible, both of these receivers are worth starting, especially against the Eagles (26.3 F.P.P.G., third most). Ever since Greg Olsen went down with an injury, Funchess has emerged as a favorite of Newton’s, averaging 8.3 targets per game over the past four weeks. He also has three touchdowns in the past two games. Benjamin had his first score of the season last week, but is averaging only five targets per game this season. The silver lining is that he has done pretty well with the targets he has gotten, averaging 10.9 yards per target (fifth highest in the N.F.L.).\n",
      "Also consider: Terrelle Pryor (WAS vs. 49ers); Jermaine Kearse (NYJ vs. Patriots)\n",
      "Tight End\n",
      "Evan Engram (NYG at Broncos) — It does feel strange recommending a player coming off zero receptions, but Engram was emerging as a consistent target of Eli Manning before Week 5, averaging more than seven targets per game, and is still fourth among all tight ends in targets with 34, even after he got only four against the Eagles last week. In case you missed it, the Giants lost all three of their starting wide receivers in Week 5, so Engram has to be involved a lot more if the Giants have any chance of resembling an N.F.L. offense this week. The Broncos also do not cover the position particularly well, having given up the seventh most F.P.P.G. (9.1) to the position.\n",

      "SUZUKA, Japan (Reuters) - The question of whether Lewis Hamilton will win his fourth Formula One world championship this year now looks more a matter of when and where after his Japanese Grand Prix triumph on Sunday.\n",
      "Fifty nine points clear of Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel with four races remaining, the Mercedes driver can wrap things up at the next race in Austin, Texas, in two weeks if everything goes to plan.\n",
      "Anything can happen in Formula One, but it will take a monumental collapse for the 32-year-old Briton to be overhauled by a rival whose challenge has imploded.\n",
      "Vettel knows the score, even if he has not given up hope entirely.\n",
      "“I don’t need to be a genius or a mathematician,” he said when asked about his chances.\n",
      "And yet Hamilton and Mercedes, a whopping 145 points clear of Ferrari in their constructors’ battle, will still cling to their mantra of one race at a time and no chickens counted until they hatch.\n",
      "“There’s no change in approach,” Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said on Sunday.\n",
      "”We’ve benefited from Ferrari’s misfortune and reliability woes in the last three races, but it doesn’t mean that we are clapping ourselves on the back. On the contrary, I think we need to continue to push.\n",
      "“You can see how quickly it goes with Sebastian.”\n",

      "Vettel had lined up in Suzuka on the front row alongside Hamilton but a humble spark plug, one of the cheapest components on a car packed with hi-tech wizardry, stopped his challenge after four laps.\n",
      "Engine failure in qualifying in Malaysia and a first-corner collision in Singapore put paid to any hopes of victory in those races.\n",
      "If Hamilton wins in Austin and the German fails to finish higher than sixth, it is game over. Mexico follows a week later and then Brazil with the chances of a decider in Abu Dhabi looking minimal.\n",
      "Sunday’s twist took the sting out of what was, until the August break, a close fight between four-times champion Vettel and triple titleholder Hamilton.\n",
      "And then Formula One went on holiday and everything changed.\n",
      "In the five races since the break, Hamilton has won four times and taken 118 points compared to a mere 45 for Vettel. The German had led his rival by 14 points after Hungary at the end of July.\n",
      "In the last four races alone, Vettel has given away 66 points to Hamilton.\n",
      "The Briton, who has finished his last 21 races in the points, said he could only have dreamed of holding such an advantage and credited his team for their efforts.\n",
      "“They’ve done a phenomenal job, reliability has really been on point,” he said.\n",

      "THE News IS: Climate change may cause nearly three times as much clear-air turbulence as current conditions by the period between 2050 and 2080, according to a study released today.\n",
      "Flights over the north Atlantic may experience as much as 180 percent more severe turbulence, or in-flight bumpiness stronger than gravity and able to shake passengers in a plane’s cabin, according to the study, published in the Geophysical Research Letters journal. Flights over North America may experience an additional 110 percent, and flights over Europe up to 160 percent more.\n",
      "“What air travelers can expect is to be confined to their seat for a lot longer in the future, because the seat belt sign will have to be on for two times or maybe three times longer,” Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading in the U.K. and the lead author of the study, told ABC News.\n",
      "Previous research has shown that clear-air turbulence, which occurs without a visual warning like clouds or thunderstorms and is usually at high altitudes, is on the rise. But scientists had only zeroed in on transatlantic flights traveling at about 39,000 feet in the winter.\n",
      "This study, using multiple computer climate models, found that turbulence is on the rise worldwide, year-round and at different altitudes.\n",
      "University of Reading\n",
      "Focusing on the invisible clear-air turbulence, researchers found that global temperature changes would lead to rougher, more frequent air pockets at higher altitudes in the jet streams -- narrow bands of powerful winds tens of thousands of feet above the Earth’s surface.\n",
      "The study authors say that turbulence is one of the largest causes of weather-related aviation accidents and clear-air turbulence has been found to account for about 24 percent of weather-related accidents. Turbulence is also one of the main causes of flight-attendant injuries, they added.\n",
      "More turbulence in the future could lead to an increase in air passenger and flight-attendant injuries, unless scientists’ ability to forecast turbulence improves, Williams said.\n",
      "\"I think we’ll see more injuries in the future, even if the number of people flying is constant, which of course it’s not,\" he said. \"That’s going up, too.\"\n",
      "Since many of the planes that will be used by 2050 haven't yet been built, researchers say aircraft design and turbulence detection technology could help reduce the effects on passengers of the future.\n",

      "THE News IS: By Aaron Kesel\n",
      "The U.S. Army secretly tested carcinogenic chemicals on unknowing residents of Canada in Winnipeg and Alberta during the Cold War in testing linked to weaponry involving radioactive ingredients meant to attack the Soviet Union, according to classified documents revealed in a new book Behind the Fog: How the U.S. Cold War Radiological Weapons Program Exposed Innocent Americans by Lisa Martino-Taylor, an associate professor of sociology at St. Louis Community College.\n",
      "The incidents occurred between July 9, 1953 and Aug 1, 1953 when they sprayed six kilograms of zinc cadmium sulfide onto unsuspecting citizens of Winnipeg from U.S. Army planes. The Army then returned 11 years later in 1964 and repeated the experiments in other parts of Canada including Suffield, Alta. and Medicine Hat, Alta., according to Martino-Taylor, National Post reported.\n",
      "“In Winnipeg, they said they were testing what they characterized as a chemical fog to protect Winnipeg in the event of a Russian attack,” Martino-Taylor said. “They characterized it as a defensive study when it was actually an offensive study.”\n",
      "Canada knowingly participated in this experiment as part of an agreement it held with the U.S. and England but was allegedly not told about what was being sprayed on its citizens, according to Martino-Taylor.\n",
      "In 1964, a memo from Canadian officials expressed concern that an “American aircraft was emitting distinctly visible emissions,” Martino-Taylor said.\n",
      "In Canadian and U.S. documents, the tests were referenced as biological and chemical when documents suggest they actually involved combining the two with radiological components to form a combined weapon.\n",
      "The U.S. was working on producing a radioactive nerve agent that combined the dangerous phosphorus-32 and VX chemical compounds.\n",
      "“The zinc cadmium sulfide acted as a fluorescent tracer which would help the U.S. Army determine how the radioactive fallout from a weapon used on the Soviets would travel through wind currents,” Martino-Taylor said.\n",
      "An additional 1964 memo from Suffield mentions that the U.S. Army wanted to travel Suffield to “discuss the use of radioactive tracer techniques in chemical weapons trials.” While preparing for other tests involving BG, a bacteria, the U.S. Army drafted the number of hospitals and hospital beds available in the area, showing a potential further connection to the CIA’s human experimentation MK-Ultra project.\n",
      "It’s a known fact the Allan Memorial Institute in Royal Victoria Hospital is seen as the cradle of modern torture, and that Scottish-born Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron was heavily involved in subproject 68. Cameron also had partial funding funneled by the CIA (approx. $62,000) and the Canadian government for its brainwashing experiments and torture, according to The McGill Daily.\n",
      "So was the U.S. planning on expanding its torture experiments into Suffield?\n",
      "For decades the massive Suffield Base in Alberta was one of the largest chemical and biological weapons research centers in the world. A 1989 Peace Magazine article explained, “For almost 50 years, scientists from the Department of National Defence have been as busy as beavers expanding their knowledge of, and testing agents for, chemical and biological warfare (CBW) in southern Alberta,” Global Research reported.\n",
      "“The U.S. was very aggressive,” Martino-Taylor said. “Canada seemed less on board as I read through the documentation.”\n",
      "Until now it was thought the U.S. only experimented on its own people, but it’s now known that they also experimented on their neighbors in Canada and tried to expand that experimentation to the levels it did in the U.S.\n",
      "The CIA did several unethical human experiments in the United States. In one instance they injected radioactive material into hospital patients without their consent at all. While other experiments were performed on pregnant women in Nashville who were given a radioactive iron cocktail to ingest so that researchers could determine if cancer could be passed on to their offspring. Even children were fed radioactive oatmeal as part of a “science club,” Martino-Taylor said.\n",
      "Yes, this is your secret history of previous deep state experiments. Another by the U.S. Army inside the continental United States revealed by Martino-Taylor also involved spraying the same zinc cadmium sulfide particles over much of the U.S. across several cities including St. Louis and Texas; that project was known as Operation LAC (Large Area Coverage.)\n",
      "The public was tricked and told the experiment was to set up smokescreens that the Army could deploy to shield the U.S. from any nuclear assault by Russia at the time. In reality, they were testing biological agents on the population harming their health.\n",
      "“The study was secretive for a reason. They didn’t have volunteers stepping up and saying yeah, I’ll breathe zinc cadmium sulfide with radioactive particles,” St Louis Professor, Martino-Taylor told KSDK. “This was a violation of all medical ethics, all international codes, and the military’s own policy at that time.”\n",
      "The report didn’t note whether the experiments in Canada were connected to Operation LAC, though it has several similarities to the project, or whether this was a bigger part of Project 112. However, for years the Canadian government has denied that it tested any bioweapons in Alaska and Alberta as well as spraying “simulated bio-weaponry across North American cities, including Winnipeg.”\n",
      "Pathogens for War, by University of Western Ontario historian Donald Avery, notes that Canadian scientists were intimately involved in U.S. bioweapons research until 1969, when then-president Richard Nixon unilaterally ended the program. Significant quantities of toxins, including sarin and the nerve agent VX, were stockpiled at Suffield until at least 1989, The Star reported.\n",
      "The U.S. government has a longstanding policy for human experimentation, experimenting on its civilian population for decades since the 1950s (Cold War) doing a total of 239 “germ-warfare” tests over populated areas.\n",
      "The United States scrapped its biological weapons program in the late 1960s and agreed in a 1997 treaty, the “Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons” to destroy all its chemical weapons.\n",
      "The goal “was to deter the use of biological weapons against the United States and its allies and to retaliate if deterrence failed,” the government explained. “Fundamental to the development of a deterrent strategy was the need for a thorough study and analysis of our vulnerability to overt and covert attack.”\n",
      "A 1997 report from the National Research Council concluded that the Army’s secret tests “did not expose residents of the United States and Canada to chemical levels considered harmful.” However, the same report admitted that there was little research on the chemical used and mostly based on very limited animal studies.\n",
      "Three House Democrats who represent areas where testing occurred — William Lacy Clay of Missouri, Brad Sherman of California and Jim Cooper of Tennessee — have expressed outrage by the revelations, NY Post reported.\n",
      "Cooper’s office plans to seek more information from the Army Legislative Liaison, spokesman Chris Carroll said.\n",
      "“We are asking for details on the Pentagon’s role, along with any cooperation by research institutions and other organizations,” Carroll said. “These revelations are shocking, disturbing and painful.” “I join with my colleagues to demand the whole truth about this testing and I will reach out to my Missouri Delegation friends on the House Armed Services Committee for their help as well,” Clay said in a statement.\n",
      "Yet the government today still denies spraying death dumps of chemicals across the sky and calls the belief a conspiracy theory, ridiculing those who accuse such practice as a “conspiracy theorist,” despite the fact that they did unethical human experimentation through the spraying of chemicals 50 years ago.\n",

      "THE News IS: NEW YORK (Reuters) - The last privately owned Leonardo da Vinci painting and one of fewer than 20 by the Renaissance artist known to still exist is hitting the auction block, Christie’s announced on Tuesday.\n",
      "“Salvator Mundi,” an ethereal portrait of Jesus Christ which dates to about 1500, is expected to sell for about $100 million at Christie’s in November, making it among the most highly-valued works ever to be sold at auction.\n",
      "“This is truly the Holy Grail of art rediscoveries,” said Alan Wintermute, Christie’s senior specialist for Old Master paintings, explaining that the portrait sometimes called the male Mona Lisa had long been thought to have been lost or destroyed.\n",
      "The portrait depicts Christ in vivid blue and crimson robes holding a crystal orb.\n",
      "First recorded in the private collection of King Charles I, the work was auctioned in 1763 before vanishing until 1900, by which time Christ’s face and hair had been painted over, which Wintermute said was “quite common” practice.\n",
      "Sold at Sotheby’s to an American collector in 1958 for 45 pounds, it again sold in 2005 as an overpainted copy of the masterwork, he said.\n",
      "\"Salvator Mundi,\" an ethereal portrait of Jesus Christ which dates to about 1500, the last privately owned Leonardo da Vinci painting, is on display for the media at Christie's auction in New York, NY, U.S., October 10, 2017. Courtesy Christie’s New York/Handout via REUTERS\n",
      "The new owner started the restoration process, and after some six years of research it was authenticated as da Vinci’s more-than 500-year-old masterpiece, which culminated in a high-profile exhibition at London’s National Gallery in 2011.\n",
      "The auction house did not identify the seller, a European private collector who acquired the work after its rediscovery in 2005 and lengthy restoration. The painting stands as the first discovery of a da Vinci painting since 1909.\n",
      "Slideshow (2 Images)\n",
      "“Salvator Mundi” will be sold at Christie’s in New York at its Nov. 15 sale of post-war and contemporary art following public exhibitions in Hong Kong, London and San Francisco.\n",
      "“We felt that offering this painting within that context is a testament to the enduring relevance of this picture,” said Loic Gouzer, chairman of Christie’s post-war and contemporary art.\n",
      "Speaking to its $100 million estimate, Wintermute reflected “There has never been anything like it sold, and so the market will decide.”\n",
      "The same sale at Christie’s will feature Andy Warhol’s monumental “Sixty Last Suppers,” a piece from one of the pop artist’s final series before his death in 1987.\n",
      "The 32-foot, multiple-image work is estimated to fetch $50 million.\n",

      "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM.O) has offered to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) without some of its patents in a bid to win EU antitrust regulatory approval for the $38 billion deal, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.\n",
      "The NXP deal, the biggest-ever in the semiconductor industry, would make Qualcomm the leading supplier to the fast-growing automotive chips market.\n",
      "Qualcomm, which supplies chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple (AAPL.O), submitted its proposal to the European Commission on Oct. 5, but did not provide details.\n",
      "The EU competition authority is worried that the merged company may provide incentives to customers to buy bundled products, thereby squeezing out rivals, or change NXP’s intellectual property licensing practices.\n",
      "Qualcomm has told regulators it will not acquire NXP’s standard essential patents, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer, the sources said.\n",
      "The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP’s near field communication (NFC) patents except for defensive purposes. NXP co-invented NFC chips which enable mobile phones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data.\n",
      "Qualcomm also offered an interoperability pledge, allowing rival products to function with NXP’s products.\n",

      "Listen again to a BBC Radio 5 live special - P1: Lewis, Mercedes and the Art of Qualifying\n",
      "A record 71 pole positions and counting.\n",
      "Of all Lewis Hamilton's many skills as a Formula 1 driver, this is one talent he has really made his own.\n",
      "Race after race, Hamilton redefines the boundaries of the possible with those flat-out laps that decide the grid order - and quite often the race victory, too.\n",
      "It is a moment when the essence of a grand prix weekend is distilled into 90 seconds of purity - the quickest cars on earth, and 20 men driving as fast as is humanly possible.\n",
      "One man in particular.\n",
      "\"It's shorter,\" Hamilton says. \"It's intense. It's enthused with so much energy. The pressure is at the utmost. You go out, and you have that one lap to perfect and deliver. I love that challenge.\n",
      "\"It is the ultimate performance, putting all the pieces of the performance together and I have always loved that. That's when you attack. It's when you really go into battle. The car is light, it is the fastest you get to drive at any point in any weekend and it all comes down to that one moment and the decisions you make and I love it.\"\n",
      "In a sport where margins are measured to the thousandth of a second, Hamilton is frequently several tenths quicker than other drivers - even ones with the same car.\n",
      "Ten poles in 16 races this season, a year when Mercedes have faced real opposition for the first time since 2014, tells its own story.\n",
      "These are laps that make the jaw drop, that generate awe and admiration, even among his rivals.\n",
      "But they are not just down to Hamilton alone.\n",
      "A qualifying lap is the culmination of all the work an F1 team puts into the weekend, and the driver could not do it without the people behind him.\n",
      "So how does Hamilton do it? BBC Sport took a deep dive behind the scenes at his Mercedes team to find out.\n",
      "The talent\n",
      "Hamilton describes himself as \"really just a small chink in the chain of a large number of people who make it possible\".\n",
      "It is not false modesty - it's a statement of fact. But it is undeniable that it would not be possible without the ability of the man in the car.\n",
      "Mercedes technical director James Allison has worked with all three of F1's current multiple world champions and describes Hamilton as \"a magnificently quick driver\".\n",
      "For me, over one lap, I don't think there is anyone as quick as Lewis, and I don't think there ever has been Jenson Button Former McLaren team-mate\n",
      "How quick? Well, in 10 years of F1 Hamilton has had five team-mates. In terms of championship points, Fernando Alonso has equalled him (in 2007), and Jenson Button (2011) and Nico Rosberg (2016) have narrowly beaten him in the title standings once, even if there were extenuating circumstances each time.\n",
      "But in raw qualifying pace - taking an average of their speed over a season on quickest laps where a comparison is possible - no-one has ever been faster.\n",
      "\"In the races we could have some great battles,\" says Button, Hamilton's team-mate at McLaren between 2010 and 2012.\n",
      "\"He'd win a race, I'd win a race, and it was really close between us. But when it came to qualifying, it wasn't. He was just immense.\"\n",
      "The psychology\n",
      "Talent on its own is not enough, though.\n",
      "An F1 car is a complex object, and it needs to be fine-tuned to get the best out of it. And a driver is a human being, prone to distractions and weaknesses, which need to be eliminated for him to operate at his best.\n",
      "Hamilton admits this has been a flaw in the past.\n",
      "\"It is definitely an area I really wanted to improve this year,\" he says. \"It has always been something I have enjoyed and generally excelled at. [But] it is all about the small percentages, and getting those extra little bits out of your own performances has really been my goal this year and I have managed to do that.\n",
      "\"You've seen how I live my life over the years and I really think the balance I allow myself to make is what enables me to perform the way I do.\n",
      "\"I arrive at the weekends in a positive frame of mind. I don't have any baggage. I generally don't give a you-know-what about what anyone says. I know my values, who I am and what I am about. I know what I am here to do, so I do it.\n",
      "\"I guess it is about building a force field against all the negativity that generally tries to penetrate. Nothing generally gets in and I know how to race and drive. It is about doing it.\"\n",
      "The change in 2017 has been noticed at Mercedes. Chief strategist James Vowles describes an upshift in Hamilton's \"attitude and approach to a race weekend\".\n",
      "\"There were times last year,\" Vowles says, \"where he would be on the back foot sometimes coming out of a Friday and it would take him time to build that confidence and ability back up as he went into the race and in the most extreme cases it would allow Nico to out-qualify him.\n",
      "\"He has aged a bit, he has become more mature with things. Things you know have failed you in the past, you fix them and improve them if you want to move forward as an elite athlete and that is what he is.\n",
      "\"So he has taken a reflection of what happened last year and improved on the small aspects things that he believes contributed perhaps to him not extracting everything in 2016. I am seeing a man who has changed and fixed those things and adapted. It is an impressive sight to see.\"\n",
      "The preparation\n",
      "The general perception of Hamilton is of a mercurial character who relies on raw talent to make up for weaknesses in the more scientific side of the requirements of a grand prix driver. But the general perception is wrong.\n",
      "Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff says: \"Lewis is a hard worker. He is very diligent in his approach and on a very steep development curve. He is someone who is never satisfied with his own performances and tries to better himself every day.\n",
      "\"He never settles. He is never happy with where he is as a racing driver and a human being. He wants to optimise, he wants to develop, and we have seen it very much in the team.\n",
      "\"He has become very much part of the leadership of the team. When times are difficult, he is calm and motivating the other members of the team but he is also capable of being very objective and natural about his and the team's performances and that made him become a strong pillar of the team.\"\n",
      "Vowles adds: \"Lewis this year has made another step as a driver. His approach to the weekends is a lot more scientific than I have seen from him before. He applies more science, more work, more practice. He is working much closer than I have seen him before with the team, because he knows everything matters in terms of the championship.\n",
      "\"That is not to say he wouldn't have done that in times of old. [But in] 2014, '15, '16 we had a car advantage and Lewis was a little more internalised; he didn't necessarily need to rally the troops as much as he is at the moment.\n",
      "\"This year, I have seen a new step from Lewis where he is able to properly exploit everything the team can provide him so they provide him everything he needs to be able to go and get pole position.\n",
      "\"It is no one element. It is not that he watches more videos or looks at more data or spends more time talking to the engineers. It is everything that he has improved by 1% that allows him to extract a lot more from the car.\"\n",
      "Hamilton says: \"Ultimately you've got these really intelligent individuals and it's about trying to make sure you get 100% out of each and every one of them. And they need to understand what they need to give you.\n",
      "\"If you don't give them the information of what you need, they can't guess. Building on our routine so they know exactly what they need to do to provide me with the platform I need to deliver what I deliver, for me to arrive into qualifying in that frame of mind I have. Collectively that's how we have the poles we have.\"\n",
      "The build-up\n",
      "Hamilton is quick to praise his team in the good times - and offer sharp words in the bad. Here he shares the victory celebrations with Mercedes' Andrew Shovlin\n",
      "The all-important laps in the the top 10 shoot-out at the end of qualifying - or Q3, as it is known - are just the climax of a long period of preparation.\n",
      "It starts back in the factory, where engineers pore over data and try to give the team what they think will be the best baseline with which to start the car at a given track.\n",
      "Through the three practice sessions, the team work with the driver to hone the car so he feels as comfortable and confident as he can taking it to the limit. And then comes the crucial hour on Saturday afternoon.\n",
      "\"Once you enter qualifying,\" Vowles says, \"you will notice quite a change of atmosphere in the team - doesn't matter whether it's Q1 or Q3, it is quite serious and orchestrated.\"\n",
      "The team have to negotiate their way through two knock-out sessions, making sure they judge the lap-time improvements of others correctly to avoid embarrassing early exits, making tyre choices and doing just enough running so the car, tyres and driver are in the best possible condition for the last 10 minutes when it really counts.\n",
      "Given the complexity of modern F1 cars, with hybrid engines, energy regeneration, hundreds of settings and temperamental tyres, it is no easy matter.\n",
      "\"You need to make sure the driver has entirely bought into the psychology of what you are trying to do in qualifying,\" Vowles says. \"There is no point giving him a set of tyres and then saying off you go. You need him to be providing feedback.\n",
      "\"If you say we have a soft tyre, you need to work with him and say: 'What do you need to get a feel for the baseline? One lap, two laps, a push lap? How does the braking change when we change engine modes, is it significant enough that you need a little practice before Q3?'\n",
      "\"A lot of it is about getting the driver in the right mental state. The car performance is one aspect of things but you are asking drivers to find the absolute limit of their and the car's performance and to do that you need the driver in the right mindset and bought into what the team is doing as a programme.\n",
      "\"Over the recent years he has just got better and better by learning how to combine that enormous talent with the understanding of the technical side of the tyres and the power unit and the chassis and bringing it all together.\"\n",
      "The lap\n",
      "A qualifying lap is a journey into the unknown. It is the fastest the car will ever go on that track, and by definition it is something the driver has never done before.\n",
      "A driver is doing something most people have only a vague understanding of. He is trying to take the himself and the car to the very limits of possibility. It requires a combination of balance, bravery, feel, dexterity and commitment that is almost indescribable.\n",
      "From the outside, on television, it might look relatively controlled, but that is the mastery of F1 drivers. In reality, the car is on the very edge at all times.\n",
      "It is when you and your car come together and your art is really displayed. On that single lap, your artistry really comes out. Not many people talk about it as art, but it is a fine art Lewis Hamilton\n",
      "It's not so much about not losing control - although that is the extreme of failure. It's more like a dance, although there is no easy metaphor.\n",
      "At each corner, the driver must brake as late as he can without locking a wheel, enter as fast as possible without sliding too much - although the car is sliding all the time - get on the accelerator as early as he can without spinning the wheels too much.\n",
      "All that while being subjected to extreme g-forces - up to 6G longitudinally during braking, well over 5G laterally in the fast corners.\n",
      "Mercedes non-executive director Niki Lauda, a three-time F1 champion, says: \"A normal human being, they operate in a normal way. They say good morning, good evening. They have breakfast, lunch and dinner and they live their normal life. Sometimes more or less exciting.\n",
      "\"But when you are a racing driver and you have to deliver, that is a different ball game. Lewis can certainly deliver.\n",
      "\"It means he sits in his car and says: 'It is one lap now, I have to get pole position.' And he switches something on which very few people have, and this on-off from nothing to everything he is able to do in no time, and then he can squeeze out the last couple of tenths.\n",
      "\"Easy to do that when you push hard, then you make a little mistake, you go too far, you brake too late, you do all these kinds of mistakes. But on his laps he does no mistakes and drives the car right to the limit on every metre of the circuit. That makes him different.\"\n",
      "Even once out on track, the lap has to be prepared before it is driven.\n",
      "Niki Lauda knows how hard it is to claim a pole position in F1. The three-time champion managed 24 of them in 171 races, a 14% strike rate. Hamilton's 71 poles have come in 204 races (34.8%)\n",
      "Lauda adds: \"He sits in the car, get the right tyres on the car. You dive out of the pits, then you have a plan. How many corners, how quick to get these tyres to the peak point at the last corner before the lap starts?\n",
      "\"So he has to bring up the temperatures. If they are too high at the start he will lose out. So he needs to understand how closely to bring the grip level to the optimum.\n",
      "\"Then he has to go flat out, brake at the absolute best point without stopping a wheel, or coming off the line. Then he turns in and gets into the rhythm of what he can do. When he does the first corner well, the next corner comes easier, still going on the limit, over the kerbs, then he is in a normal rhythm to finish the lap. So if the tyres do not go weak in the lap, which can happen if he pushes too hard, then he has pole position.\"\n",
      "For Hamilton, this is the moment where all that preparation gives way to instinct and ability. Not for him techniques beloved of sports psychologists such as visualisation.\n",
      "\"I have never visualised a lap,\" he says. \"I tried it many years ago. For me personally, it is a complete waste of time. It did nothing for me.\n",
      "\"You can't predict what you are about to do. You can't put in your mind that you are going to turn at this point.\n",
      "\"It is the greatest thing about racing these cars, it's that it's all on the dime, it's all on the split second - how you react, about the snap overseer that comes. You can't predict that; you just have to be ready. It is about being on your toes and I love that. So many balls are coming from so many different directions.\n",
      "\"What I can definitely advise any kid that's out there trying to race, don't listen to people who tell you you need a mental coach or you need someone to help control your mind.\n",
      "\"You need to let it run wild and free and discover yourself. It is all about discovery. And only you can do it. No-one can tell you: 'Don't do that because I have done it before.' You have to experience it in order to learn and grow from it.\"\n",
      "What does he do that others don't?\n",
      "Hamilton is just the sixth driver to hold the outright record for F1 pole positions, after Juan Manuel Fangio, Alberto Ascari, Jim Clark, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher\n",
      "Driving an F1 car is all about adaptation. The car is very rarely perfectly balanced. It will always have a handling characteristic that the driver would rather was not there - a slight lack of front grip (understeer), too much rear sliding (oversteer), whatever. What marks out the best drivers is their ability to adapt to those problems and deliver the very best anyway.\n",
      "Button says: \"With the car, even if the balance wasn't quite there, Lewis was strong. He would drive the car from the rear. He didn't mind oversteer on entry, apex, exit. He was a little bit more ragged than my style, but it works.\"\n",
      "Vowles adds: \"Of all the drivers I've ever worked with, Lewis is the one who is able to quickly and dynamically react to a changing set of circumstances. That's one of the key reasons as to why he is so good in qualifying.\n",
      "\"You have echelons of drivers throughout the grid. You have the Alonsos, the Lewises and the Vettels of this world, who are at times in a league of their own. Until you have referenced them all together at the same time in the same car you will never be able to answer who is the best.\n",
      "\"I think Fernando is exceptional as well but there are times when he isn't extracting everything that car has to bring - at all. It is difficult to find your motivation perhaps when you are behind but with Lewis I don't ever see that lack of motivation. And again Sebastian there are times where he had a faster car and Lewis has managed to beat him. By milliseconds - but has managed to beat him.\"\n",
      "The impact\n",
      "When Hamilton broke the all-time record for pole positions this year, one phrase kept coming up in responses from his fellow drivers: He deserves it.\n",
      "They all know how good he is. They see that he is doing things that are special and unexpected, that he is getting speed out of the car that, for all their data and computer predictions, not even the team knew were there.\n",
      "The most recent example was Malaysia two weeks ago. Mercedes had the third fastest car at Sepang, yet Hamilton somehow put it on pole. Team-mate Valtteri Bottas was fifth on the grid, 0.7secs behind.\n",
      "You'd get to Q3, and even if his first run wasn't so good, he'd come out and he'd be 0.2secs in front and you'd go: 'I don't know where that came from' Jenson Button Former McLaren team-mate\n",
      "\"On all the statistics I had,\" Vowles says, \"we were not on pole that weekend. We had been off-set by 1.4 secs on Friday, by 0.6-0.7secs on Saturday morning. And there is nothing in any of those metrics that tell you: 'Yeah it will all be fine if you push a bit more and turn the power-unit up, pole will be yours.\n",
      "\"That's what I call exceeding expectations. I was ecstatic in Malaysia. I can't explain it any other way, because it is an achievement you know you've realised because you have a driver who is able to extract everything from the car at any one given time.\"\n",
      "For Vowles, though, that was not even Hamilton's best lap of the year.\n",
      "\"It was one that definitely blew me away but I don't think it was his best of 2017,\" he says. \"I would have to go back through my notes but there were others that I thought were a much better achievement overall.\n",
      "\"The way I define a best lap is not just where he finishes relative to the field, it's how clean it was, how he built up, did he make any mistakes, any small lock-ups, any small adjustments in the steering wheel. And I believe there was one prior to that where it was perfect and I can't remember which one, I'm afraid.\"\n",
      "Hamilton's 39 wins from pole is eclipsed only by Michael Schumacher, who won 40 times from the front of the grid - it is yet another record that Hamilton seems destined to eclipse before long\n",
      "After the interview, Vowles checked his notes and it turned out there were actually two laps that exceeded Malaysia. They were Silverstone, where he was on pole by 0.5secs from Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen and 0.8secs quicker than Bottas, and Italy, where in the wet he was 1.1secs quicker than anyone else and 2.3secs up on his team-mate.\n",
      "Brawn says: \"It's a very special experience as an engineer or team principal to know that the guy is going to pull his belts in a bit tighter, take a deep breath and find something that is almost indefinable. There are only a few people who've got that.\n",
      "\"That raw talent; it's that one, two, three tenths. The interesting thing is that team-mates in those circumstances can never work out where it's coming from.\n",
      "\"You always see it. They get a new team-mate. They come up against that raw talent. They want to find the reason why it's there and ultimately they have to understand the guy's special.\"\n",

      "THE News IS: The Progression of Type 2 Diabetes Treatments By Allie Lemco Toren\n",
      "Was this helpful? ( 35 )\n",
      "Each year, about 1.4 million people are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and must embark on a lifelong journey to manage this chronic condition. Diabetes develops when your body doesn’t respond well to insulin, which is a hormone made in your pancreas. Insulin is responsible for helping your body properly use sugar (glucose) from your food—your body typically uses glucose for energy, but when you have diabetes, this process doesn’t work. To treat the condition, you’ve got to take steps to get things functioning well again. There are many ways to do this—first, you’ll need to make some lifestyle changes, and then your doctor will likely prescribe medications, before finally turning to insulin injections. Everyone’s path is different, and it might take a few tries to find the right treatment for you, but keep in mind that your doctor will be with you every step of the way.\n",

May not be reproduced or reprinted without permission from Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. Use of this information is governed by the Healthgrades User Agreement.\n",
      "Lifestyle Changes\n",
      "Not everyone diagnosed with diabetes needs medication at first. It might be that you just need to make healthy lifestyle changes. Your doctor will likely connect you with a certified diabetes educator, who can work with you to make these changes and get control of your diabetes. This may mean an overhaul of your typical diet, making sure you get plenty of high-fiber, low-fat foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. You’ll also want to eat fewer refined carbohydrates (like white bread and rice), less meat, and fewer sweets. You’ll start on a fitness routine to get your body more active and promote weight loss, and you’ll also want to try some stress relief techniques, like yoga or meditation, to keep blood pressure down and promote good overall health.\n",
      "Oral Medications\n",
      "However, often lifestyle changes aren’t enough to help you gain control of your diabetes, so your doctor will turn to oral medications. These pills work in different ways to get your blood sugar levels balanced. Keep in mind, though, that the combination of oral medications and lifestyle changes is the most effective way to manage your diabetes—just because you’re prescribed medication doesn’t mean you should quit going to the gym or stop watching what you eat.\n",
      "There are several different types of oral diabetes medications your doctor can prescribe. The most common medication is called metformin, and it works by limiting how much sugar your liver releases into your bloodstream. Other types of diabetes pills stimulate your pancreas to release more insulin, so it can regulate your blood sugar levels. And there are some drugs that manage your blood sugar levels by both limiting the amount of glucose your body makes and stimulating insulin production.\n",
      "Sometimes, diabetes pills stop working after a period of time—they may stop being effective after just a few months or a few years. Often, we’re not sure exactly why they don’t work anymore, but it doesn’t mean your diabetes has gotten worse. In the past, when this happened, doctors would put patients on insulin right away. However, today we have many more options to try before insulin. In these cases, your doctor may prescribe you more than one oral medication to take; this is called combination therapy. There are even medications available that combine two oral drugs in one pill, so you’re not taking lots of pills every day. Many people take two or three kinds of oral diabetes pills to manage their condition, and some even take pills and insulin together, or pills and non-insulin injections together. It all depends on your specific case, and your doctor will work to find the right fit for you.\n",
      "Non-Insulin Injectable Medications\n",
      "In recent years, a new type of diabetes drug has come onto the market—the non-insulin injectable. If oral drugs aren’t helping you stay in control of your diabetes, your doctor might prescribe you a non-insulin injectable medication. They work by increasing the amount of insulin your body makes and decreasing the amount of sugar your body sends into your bloodstream. If you have a hard time remembering to take your pills several times a day, non-insulin injectables can be a good option; it depends on the specific medication, but some are injected once a week, once a day, or twice a day.\n",

      "THE News IS: Mike Schroepfer, CTO of Facebook, speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 18, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n",
      "SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - Facebook Inc has begun overhauling how it handles political ads on its platform and may put some changes in place before U.S. elections next year, Facebook’s chief technology officer said on Wednesday.\n",
      "U.S. congressional and state elections set for November 2018 present a deadline of sorts for Facebook and other social media companies to get better at halting the kind of election meddling that the United States accuses Russia of.\n",
      "“We are working on all of this stuff actively now, so there is a big focus in the company to improve all of this on a regular basis,” Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer said in an interview.\n",
      "“You’re going to see a regular cadence of updates and changes,” he said, speaking on the sidelines of a conference that Facebook is hosting about virtual reality technology.\n",
      "Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said last month that the company would begin treating political ads differently from other ads, including by making it possible for anyone to see political ads, no matter whom they target. U.S. lawmakers had begun calling for regulations.\n",
      "Disclosures by Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google that their products were battlegrounds for Russian election meddling last year have turned into a crisis for Silicon Valley.\n",
      "Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, is in Washington this week meeting U.S. lawmakers.\n",
      "Moscow has denied allegations of meddling in last year’s U.S. presidential election.\n",
      "Implementing changes is tricky, Schroepfer said, because Facebook does not want to stifle legitimate speech and because of the volume of material on Facebook, the world’s largest social network with 2 billion users and 5 million advertisers.\n",
      "“We’re investing very heavily in technical solutions, because we’re operating at an unprecedented scale,” he said.\n",
      "Facebook is also using humans. The company said this month it would hire 1,000 more people to review ads and ensure they meet its terms.\n",
      "Schroepfer, 42, has been Facebook’s CTO since 2013 and previously was director of engineering. He also sits on Facebook’s board of directors.\n",
      "Facebook has dealt with problematic user-generated content in the past, he said.\n",
      "“We don’t want misuse of the platform, whether that’s a foreign government trying to intercede in a democracy - that’s obviously not OK - or whether it’s an individual spewing hate or uploading pornography,” he said.\n",

      "Yankees 1, Indians 0\n",
      "Greg Bird led off the bottom of the seventh inning with a homer, and Aroldis Chapman posted a five-out save as the New York Yankees staved off elimination Sunday night with a 1-0 victory over the Cleveland Indians in Game 3 of the American League Division Series.\n",
      "Bird helped the Yankees force Game 4 on Monday night when he lifted a 95 mph fastball on a 1-1 count from left-hander Andrew Miller (0-1) about halfway up in the second deck in right field.\n",
      "It was only the second homer allowed by Miller to a left-handed hitter this season.\n",
      "After Miller gave up Bird’s homer, David Robertson recorded the first out of the eighth but walked Michael Brantley, earning a hook from manager Joe Girardi.\n",
      "Chapman struck out pinch hitter Yan Gomes on a 102 mph fastball after making three pickoff attempts at first on pinch runner Greg Allen. The left-hander ended the eighth by blowing a 102 mph fastball by Giovanny Urshela.\n",
      "With one out in the ninth, Chapman gave up a single to Jason Kipnis and an infield hit to Jose Ramirez, putting runners at first and second. Chapman secured the win by fanning Jay Bruce and retiring Carlos Santana on a fly ball to deep center field.\n",
      "Masahiro Tanaka (1-0) scattered three hits in seven outstanding innings. He struck out seven, walked one, threw 92 pitches, induced two double plays and received defensive help from right fielder Aaron Judge.\n",
      "Cleveland’s Carlos Carrasco, who missed last year’s postseason recovering from a hand injury, allowed three hits in 5 2/3 scoreless innings but exited after loading the bases in the sixth.\n",
      "Cleveland’s first real threat occurred in the fourth inning when Kipnis tripled to deep right field. Judge’s misplay of the ball (he was not given an error) featured him kicking the ball toward right-center field as Kipnis sped into third base.\n",
      "Tanaka rebounded by striking out Jose Ramirez and Bruce.\n",
      "The Yankees got their first hit when Didi Gregorius singled up the middle but he was stranded when Castro chased a breaking ball for Carrasco’s sixth strikeout to end the fourth.\n",
      "The Indians threatened again in the fifth when Carlos Santana led off with a walk and Austin Jackson fouled off four consecutive pitches. Tanaka used his curveball to retire Jackson on a fly ball to the warning track in right field before getting a double play three pitches later.\n",

      "Game Four is in Boston on Monday with Houston, which leads the best-of-five series 2-1, trying to close out the Red Sox.\n",
      "Rafael Devers hit a go-ahead two-run home run, the first of the 20-year-old’s postseason career, in the third inning to give the Red Sox a 4-3 lead, their first of the series.\n",
      "Devers, who finished with three runs batted in, became the youngest Red Sox player ever (20 years, 349 days) to hit a home run in a playoff game and just the sixth player in major league history to homer in the postseason before turning 21.\n",
      "Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a three-run homer, also his first career playoff blast, while Hanley Ramirez went 4-for-4 with three RBIs and Sandy Leon drove in another run for the Red Sox.\n",
      "Slideshow (2 Images)\n",
      "Boston received four shutout innings of relief and four strikeouts from David Price to keep them in front in a close game early on. Joe Kelly (1-0) earned the win with 1 2/3 scoreless innings in relief of starter Doug Fister.\n",
      "Carlos Correa hit a two-run homer, his second of the series, and Josh Reddick added an RBI for the Astros.\n",
      "Fister was pulled after giving up three runs in 1 1/3 innings, marking the shortest postseason outing for a Red Sox starter since Bret Saberhagen (one inning) on Oct. 11, 1999.\n",
      "Fister allowed four hits, walked one and struck out one.\n",
      "Houston starter Brad Peacock departed after 2 2/3 innings having allowed three runs on six hits with one walk and four strikeouts in his first career postseason appearance.\n",
      "Astros reliever Francisco Liriano (0-1) gave up the go-ahead homer to Devers and took the loss.\n",
      "Houston enjoyed another fast start against a shaky Fister, scoring three runs in the first inning.\n",
      "Reddick’s RBI single two batters into the game opened the scoring and was followed by Correa’s blast of approximately 385 feet to center field the next at-bat to make it 3-0.\n",
      "Boston got one run back on Leon’s single with the bases loaded and nobody out in the second, but Peacock retired the next three batters to escape the jam.\n",
      "Ramirez brought the Red Sox within a run on his two-out RBI single before Devers delivered his homer of an estimated 430 feet over the bullpens in right-center to put Boston ahead.\n",
      "A bases-loaded single with nobody out in the seventh by Ramirez and a bloop RBI single from Devers the next at-bat put Boston ahead 7-3.\n",
      "Bradley smacked his homer to right two batters later to make it 10-3.\n",

      "THE News IS: (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said its recently approved breast cancer drug failed to meet a late-stage trial’s main goal of improving overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\n",
      "The news comes as a blow to the drugmaker, which has suffered setbacks on two potential blockbuster treatments over the past year - the delay of a rheumatoid arthritis drug, as well as the failure of an experimental Alzheimer’s treatment.\n",
      "A positive data in lung cancer patients would have given the drug, Verzenio, a competitive edge over rival breast cancer treatments such as Pfizer Inc’s Ibrance and Novartis AG Kisqali.\n",
      "The drugmaker said on Tuesday that the late-stage trial was testing Verzenio in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with mutation of the KRAS gene, whose cancer has progressed despite initial therapies.\n",
      "The drug, whose chemical name is abemaciclib, was being compared with Roche’s erlotinib, sold under the brand name Tarceva.\n",
      "Verzenio belongs to a newer class of oral medicines called CDK 4/6 inhibitors that block cancer cells’ ability to divide and proliferate.\n",
      "Last month, the FDA approved the drug to treat advanced breast cancer that has progressed following prior treatment.\n",
      "Verzenio, however, showed some evidence of improvement in the latest trial’s secondary goals such as progression-free survival in patients and overall response rate, Lilly said.\n",
      "The company currently has several ongoing trials evaluating Verzenio in non-small cell lung cancer, including a combination trial with Keytruda or chemotherapy, and does not plan to discontinue them, Guggenheim analyst Tony Butler wrote in a client note.\n",
      "Lung cancer is by far the largest oncology market in the United States with Merck & Co Inc’s Keytruda leading the space.\n",
      "Keytruda is an immuno-oncology drug, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body’s natural killer cells to home in on tumors.\n",
      "Lilly’s shares fell 1.2 percent to $85.99 in afternoon trade on Tuesday.\n",
      "The company last month laid off 8 percent of its employees in order to save around $500 million a year and made significant changes to its management.\n",

      "THE News IS: It was a smart move. South Plains, whose emergence as the junior college Warriors was detailed by The New York Times, won its first 29 games of the season, averaged nearly 100 points per game and reached the semifinals of the national tournament.\n",
      "Now on the cusp of his 18th season at South Plains, Green has a new roster, with only three returning players, and more size. (“We built through the draft,” he said, deadpan.) But his best player, the high-scoring guard Jordan Brangers, is back for another season, and Green plans to stick with much of his Warriors-centric offense.\n",
      "“Oh, yeah,” he said. “I’m a groupie.”\n",
      "After the Warriors welcomed Green’s request to visit their training camp, he feels as if he has an even better gauge for how they operate. Kerr has a fairly open policy when coaches express an interest in sneaking backstage to catch a glimpse of his basketball cyborgs.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "“We don’t have any secrets,” Kerr said, “and if these guys are interested in coming to watch us practice, there’s no harm in it and there’s a lot of benefit. I like for them to see what we’re doing, and if it helps them and their teams and their players develop, I’m all for it.”\n",
      "Bruce Fraser, one of Kerr’s assistants, said he often wondered how much other coaches gained from watching the Warriors practice. They dribble around traffic cones. They shoot 3-pointers and play loud music.\n",
      "“I don’t know if underwhelmed is the word,” Fraser said, “but you may look out there and say: ‘Is that all they do?’”\n",
      "He added that much of the Warriors’ offense was so nuanced that it must be difficult for someone to just pop in for a day or two and acquire a ton of insight.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "Still, that did not appear to be the case for a shooting coach from Belgium, who peppered Fraser with questions for about 20 minutes after a recent practice. And it certainly was not true of Green, whose depth of knowledge about the Warriors runs so deep that he can watch a game live on TV and identify whether Kerr has plugged in a new play.\n",
      "At practice, Green said, a couple of things stood out to him from the start. The first, he said, was the Warriors’ chemistry. At different moments, Kerr would bring everyone together so they could talk. Green was not privy to their conversations — the balcony was out of eavesdropping range — but it looked like democracy in action.\n",

      "Then there were the high-fives. So many high-fives.\n",
      "“You couldn’t walk by somebody without acknowledging them or being acknowledged,” Green said. “And it wasn’t just players. All the coaches, all the staff members — everyone. It sounds kind of crazy, but I’d never seen so many high-fives.”\n",
      "Beyond the emphasis on team-building, Green was struck by the Warriors’ focus on fundamentals: dribbling, shooting, passing. For a solid chunk of each practice that Green attended, the players threw dozens of passes against large pitch-back nets that were configured with targets. The Warriors love to pass, but Kerr wants them to be more precise.\n",
      "“You can see on tape if a guy is catching the ball at his shoelaces instead of in his shooting pocket,” Kerr said recently. “There’s a dramatic difference in his makes and misses when you get a good pass or a bad pass, so we’re trying to work on that.”\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "Green also noticed that the Warriors were efficient. Nobody stood around doing nothing. Assistants divided the team up to work on various offensive sets at different baskets. One coach was in charge of practicing out-of-bounds plays. Players cycled through the stations. Green got a little jealous.\n",
      "“We can’t do that because I don’t have 22 assistants,” he said. (He has two.)\n",
      "“I also don’t have three courts,” he added. (He has one.)\n",
      "But as he watched All-Stars like Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson during their individual shooting drills, Green was struck by their meticulous approach. They were craftsmen. No wasted movement. Just shot after shot, and only the types of shots they would attempt in games.\n",
      "“These guys are serious about improving their skills,” Green said. “You read these articles about LeBron James and his summer workouts, and you don’t ever know for sure. But if you actually go and watch, these guys are serious. They are serious about keeping their jobs and getting better.”\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "After one of the practices, Kerr worked his way up to the balcony. Green introduced himself.\n",
      "“Oh!” Kerr told him. “You’re that coach from Texas.”\n",
      "They made small talk about mutual acquaintances. As an assistant at the University of Houston in the 1980s, Green had coached Randy Brown, a guard who later played for the Chicago Bulls alongside Kerr. (“Great teammate,” Kerr said.) Green also mentioned that Emmanuel Omogbo, one of his former players at South Plains, was on the Warriors’ summer league team.\n",
      "Kerr talked a bit about his offense and his personnel. Green enjoyed the conversation. He followed it up with a trip to California’s wine country. He was not in top shape the next morning.\n",
      "Back at South Plains last week for his team’s first practice of the season, Green told his players about the Warriors’ penchant for high-fives. The message carried only so much weight.\n",
      "“Two of my guys got into it before the day was over,” he said with a hint of resignation.\n",
      "Green also remembered that he had some old equipment tucked away: traffic cones. He had his players dust them off.\n",

      "THE News IS: “We chop the stuff up and see how it falls into grooves and moods,” Mr. Plant said. “That’s basically the whole signature of our music: grooves and moods.” As the tracks cohere into songs, he mines a notebook he’s scribbled in for years for lyrics: “I have a lot of lyrics, and if they’re not interrelated they can be,” he said. The vocal melodies are also all Mr. Plant, delivered in a haunting, otherworldly mode. “I tried with this record to make melodies really, really important,” he said. “And to use celestial backing vocals to create a different R.P.”\n",
      "The result is a heady, autumnal record, blending Mr. Plant’s early influences (the folk musicians Bert Jansch and John Fahey), blues-fueled riffs, Berber sounds and Bristol trip-hop sonics. Many of the songs, including the title track, are love ballads tinged with fables. In contrast, “Carving Up the World Again … A Wall Not a Fence” is a Sun Records-ish stomper spiked with a curling, Middle Eastern guitar solo that delves into post-“Brexit” and President Trump discourse. Taking part of its title from a quote by Mr. Trump, Mr. Plant takes aim at jingoism and the refugee crisis. “There’s progress in many areas of humanity, but it’s juxtaposed with doors slamming and pain,” he said.\n",

      "The sole cover, of an old rockabilly tune called “Bluebirds Over the Mountain,” gets new energy from a fractured electronic beat and the twinned vocals of Mr. Plant and the Pretenders’ Chrissie Hynde.\n",
      "Mr. Plant is delighted that there’s still an audience for his music and a major record label, Nonesuch, invested in releasing it into the world. But that’s about as much thought as he puts into who might be out there listening. He emphatically does not delve into Spotify data to learn more. “No, I don’t give a hoot,” he says. “I couldn’t even think about it. I don’t think I write to suit anybody — I just write to suit my mood.”\n",
      "As for his old band, Mr. Plant said he sees Mr. Page and the bassist John Paul Jones “from time to time, and it’s very civil.” The three were thrown back together in 2016 during a high-profile copyright lawsuit over the song “Stairway to Heaven,” which the band won, but Mr. Plant doesn’t seem eager to relive that: “We’re enthusiastic toward each other, and each of us does our own things, and that’s how it is.”\n",
      "When Led Zeppelin ended in 1980, Mr. Plant set out to live a more human-scale life. To the public annoyance of his old bandmates, he’s been emphatic about not reviving the band for a full-scale tour, and when asked about it he tends to make an artistic argument about wanting to resist nostalgia. (Fans of “Raising Sand” have more reason to hope: “Alison and I talk about it all the time.”) But there might be another, simpler, reason — maybe there just isn’t any payday, no matter how vast, worth more than his carefully cultivated life?\n",
      "“Yeah, that’s true,” he said. “I know where it’s at for me. I’m in an incredibly good place. For a guy like me, who was a singer in band, who played no instrument — but just being eager to learn and experience more and more music? I’ve just been incredibly fortunate. I’m in the middle of my own joy. I don’t need anything else.”\n",

      "The team seems to think that the object is around 800 to 900 kilometers span when measuring the brightness of it. Pluto is 2, 370 kilometers, for scale. What could be a dwarf planet is said to be around 78.3 astronomical units past the Kuiper Belt and 1 AU is equal to the distance between the Earth and Sun. Pluto is 39.5 AU and Neptune is 30.5 AU.\n",

      "The object seen by the scientists seems to have a red coloration and this seems to be a trait of the outer Solar System. MU69 has a color that is very similar and this is an object that is much smaller in the Kuiper Belt and one that the New Horizons probe is bearing down on at a rapid rate.\n",
      " \n",
      "The 2010 JO179 is said to be round in shape and it completes a rotation in 30.6 hours. What the astronomers have found to be interesting is that the object is in a resonance of 21: 5 with Neptune. The team pointed out that the object had not been seen before due to the fact that it does orbit at an angle that is high, 30 degrees, when compared to the remainder of the Milky Way and so even though it is bright; it was out of the region of others who made searchers.\n",

      "How Many More Objects Might Be Undetected?\n",

      "This discovery is said to be of importance as it gives a hint that there might be many more objects that have not been noticed yet in the same region, more so when in a resonance with Neptune that is similar. The researchers have said that there are about 6,700 objects that measure over 100 kilometers in diameter.\n",
      " \n",
      "It was said that while the object more than likely formed in the position that it is in currently in the Solar System. However, the researchers said that they would not discount the premise that it could have been captured into the current orbit. This would not be the only dwarf planet that had been found in the outer Solar System.\n",

      "THE News IS: (CNN) \"Blade Runner 2049\" boasts such an enticing assortment of elements it's frustrating that they aren't assembled into a movie that fully delivers on its promise. Yet despite Ryan Gosling, a striking visual template and Harrison Ford reprising the role he played in the 1982 sci-fi classic, glitches mar this undeniably ambitious but drawn-out exercise.\n",
      "Director Denis Villaneuve (\"Arrival\") looked like an inspired choice to put a modern spin on this cerebral thriller. And in much the way that HBO's \"Westworld\" brought fresh considerations to Michael Crichton's movie, this 35-years-later sequel introduces ideas and concerns about renegade robots and artificial intelligence that feel very much suited to where we are now.\n",
      "The movie, however, perhaps tackles too much, incorporating clever callbacks to its cinematic predecessor while seeking to carve out its own expansive narrative. The pacing, too, is somewhat off, with the first two thirds of the film -- which runs 2 hours, 44 minutes -- feeling a tad too leisurely, as if luxuriating in its futuristic dystopia, before rushing toward its slightly messy climactic act.\n",
      "\" allowfullscreen>\n",
      "From that perspective, it's possible to admire \"Blade Runner\" for what it endeavors to do -- and recommend seeing it on that level -- without feeling completely satisfied.\n",
      "The filmmakers have understandably asked that reviews be as spoiler-free as possible, but the basic outline has been spelled out in the promotional material. It's been more than 30 years since the events of the original, with a new Blade Runner, K (Gosling), being drawn into a case that ties back into whatever happened to Ford's Deckard, who has disappeared.\n",

      "THE News IS: Photographer Alan Dyer looked into the night sky in Alberta, Canada on 27 September and saw a huge purple mysterious ribbon of light arching over the sky. This was a mysterious aurora that is known by the name of Steve.\n",

      "Strange Aurora Captured In 360 Degree Panorama\n",
      " \n",
      "The strange arc showed for around just 20 minutes, and it began at 10.45pm MDT explained Dyer, who had been shooting photographs and managed to capture the mysterious purple arc with six photographs in a 360-degree panorama.\n",
      " \n",
      "The mysterious arc had been seen by a group of sky watchers called the Alberta Aurora Chasers for many years. They reported having seen a luminous form that would occasionally be seen dancing with the other more regular auroras. This phenomenon had been called a proton arc until it was pointed out by researchers that protons did not have anything to do with it. The members of the group then changed the name to Steve.\n",

One of the Swarm satellites of the European Space Agency flew into Steve when the strange phenomenon occurred previously. The data that came back showed that a hot river of gas which was around 25km in width flowed fast through the outer atmosphere of the Earth. Dyer said that Steve had seemed to be a hot flowing gas thermal emission instead of being associated with precipitating electrons. He went on to say that the origin along with the nature of it was still mysterious.\n",

      "The title character of George Kelly’s 1924 play “The Show-Off” is a boasting buffoon named Aubrey Piper — a vain, dissembling blowhard with an obvious toupee and galloping delusions of grandeur. Spencer Tracy starred as Aubrey in the comedy’s second movie adaptation, Red Skelton in the third, but the team behind the play’s current Off Broadway revival seems to have taken inspiration from another star altogether.\n",
      "A note tucked into the program at the Theater at St. Clement’s coyly likens Aubrey to “a well-known political figure of our day.” I don’t know about you, but I’m guessing they mean the guy who was the boss on “The Apprentice” before he moved into the White House this year.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "It’s an intriguing thought, but it doesn’t really gain traction in Dan Wackerman’s disjointed production for the Peccadillo Theater Company. Its chief asset is Annette O’Toole as Mrs. Fisher, an unpretentious Philadelphian whose younger daughter, Amy (Emma Orelove), is inexplicably besotted with Aubrey (Ian Gould) — believing his lie that he is a bigwig at the Pennsylvania Railroad, rather than a mere clerk making $32.50 a week.\n",
      "As he hangs about the Fisher parlor, blathering into the wee hours, Mrs. Fisher knits furiously in the next room, unable to stop their courtship, which becomes an engagement, which becomes a marriage. Aubrey is pretty much the last person she would want in the family — her husband (Douglas Rees) can’t even bear to be around this hearty backslapper who could bore the paint off the walls — yet here he is.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "On a comfortably lived-in set by Harry Feiner, Ms. O’Toole gives a resolutely naturalistic performance, and so does the charming Tirosh Schneider as Joe, Mrs. Fisher’s dreamily science-minded son. The dramatic sparks between Ms. O’Toole and Mr. Schneider suggest what the production might have been if all of the principals were operating on the same aesthetic plane.\n",

      "THE News IS: That Gomes even became a baseball player is surprising when you consider he was born in Brazil, the son of Decio Gomes, a former professional tennis player and current coach. But thanks in part to the influence of Japanese immigration to São Paulo, Gomes was introduced to baseball at a young age, showed promise, and chose it over tennis.\n",
      "“My friends never asked me why he doesn’t play tennis,” Decio Gomes said in a telephone interview from his home in Miami. “They said, ‘Why doesn’t he play soccer?’ ”\n",
      "Soccer, of course, is the pulse of Brazil. But when Yan was a boy, his hometown, Mogi das Cruzes, was known for its youth baseball program. Yan and his two brothers loved the game, and continued to play it after the family moved to Miami when Yan was about 12.\n",
      "Decio Gomes, who had grown up in a tennis-playing family, initially tried to carve out a career on the sport’s satellite tour, as it used to be known. He played in small tournaments across South America for little money, but after two years of that uncompromising life, he turned to coaching. Most recently, he is the varsity tennis coach (boys and girls) at Westminster Christian Academy, Alex Rodriguez’s old school.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Yan and his brothers played tennis here and there as they grew up. The family, after relocating to Miami, were regular visitors to the annual tournament in Key Biscayne, Fla. Yan said he once had the opportunity at a clinic to hit with Justin Gimelstob and guesses that he might be the biggest tennis fan among professional baseball players.\n",
      "He watches the big tournaments when he has the chance, and in August he spotted Madison Keys, the United States Open women’s finalist, in the lobby of the Indians’ Manhattan hotel.\n",
      "“I don’t think anyone else on the team knew who she was,” Gomes said.\n",
      "Decio Gomes believes that his son’s early foray into tennis may have helped his hand-eye coordination. Learning to serve might have contributed to his son’s catapult arm, which is among the best in baseball.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "But Sandy Alomar Jr., an Indians coach and a former catcher, believes that Gomes’s strong, accurate throws are also the product of his uncanny ability to quickly extract the ball from his glove and get into a throwing motion, something Gomes and his fellow Indians catcher Roberto Perez work on regularly with Alomar.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "“His transfer is one of the best I’ve ever seen,” Alomar said.\n",
      "Terry Francona, the Indians’ manager, also noted that because Gomes and Perez are so feared behind the plate, the Indians rarely have to pitch out to catch potential base stealers, saving pitchers from unfavorable counts.\n",

      "“I bet you we’re toward the bottom of the league in pitching out,” Francona said, and added: “We don’t have to put our pitchers in a hole, because those guys throw so well. It’s been a big weapon for us the last couple years.”\n",
      "On his pickoff throw to second base on Friday, Gomes never left his knees and still fired a strike.\n",
      "For Gomes, now 30, it was the product of hard work dating to his childhood. He may have dabbled in tennis, but he was singularly devoted to baseball. His father said that when his son was growing up, he never asked to have a birthday party because it was in July and he was always more interested in playing in tournaments for his baseball travel teams.\n",
      "That dedication was rewarded, first in a college career at the University of Tennessee and later at Barry University in Miami Shores, Fla., and still later by a 10th-round draft selection in 2009 by the Toronto Blue Jays.\n",
      "Gomes built on his reputation as a relentless worker as he moved through the minor leagues, and he made his major league debut against the Yankees in 2012, collecting two hits off Phil Hughes. But after that season, the Blue Jays traded him to Cleveland with Mike Aviles for pitcher Esmil Rogers.\n",
      "At the time, Gomes was more of a utility player. But Cleveland’s bullpen coach was Kevin Cash, a former catcher and now the manager of the Tampa Bay Rays. Cash had been a scout with Toronto and felt strongly that Gomes would excel as a catcher.\n",
      "“Kevin was a big part of our decision to get Yan,” said Chris Antonetti, the Indians’ general manager. “It worked out really well.”\n",
      "Antonetti also noted that even if Gomes was never the most naturally gifted player, he was as dedicated as anyone else in the game. That, in fact, is part of Gomes’s ethos.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "“I can’t promise that I will put up amazing numbers,” Gomes said he would tell them, “but I will promise that I will show up and work hard every single day. I truly believe that if you work hard, it’s going to pay off. If you don’t, there is always someone out there trying to take your job.”\n",
      "Or, in the case of his at-bat against Betances, there is always some talented pitcher trying to get you out. What impressed Allen, the Indians’ closer, the most in that plate appearance was that Gomes had to be guarding against one of Betances’s feared breaking balls. But within a microsecond he would shift his focus, foul off the pitch and keep the at-bat going.\n",
      "“After seeing six nasty breaking balls, he gets 98 up around the shoulders?” Allen said. “That’s really, really hard just to get a piece of it. He just battles and battles and battles.”\n",
      "And now with a deciding Game 5 in the series looming on Wednesday night, the question is whether Gomes will have a key moment where he can battle some more.\n",

      "First, there is a coin toss. The visiting team gets to choose heads or tails. The team winning the toss gets to choose whether to kick or receive to start overtime.\n",
      "In general, the team that scores first wins the game. There is one exception to this, however.\n",
      "If the team receiving the kick scores a field goal on its first possession, the game is not over. The other team gets a shot with the ball. If it scores a touchdown, it wins. If it fails to score, it loses. If it also kicks a field goal, the game continues, with the next scorer of any points the winner.\n",
      "If the game remains tied after 10 minutes, it ends and is recorded as a tie. There were two ties in the N.F.L. in the 2016 season.\n",

      "TOKYO — Japan still faces deep structural problems. Its population is aging and dwindling. China has stepped up its manufacturing game. Corporate stalwarts like Toshiba and Kobe Steel have stumbled.\n",
      "Investors appear to be looking at the bright side.\n",
      "Japan’s main stock index rose to its highest level in almost 21 years on Wednesday, buoyed by a broad rally in global markets as well as growing optimism about the Japanese economy. The surge came despite the continuing problems at Kobe Steel, a Japanese stock market stalwart. Its shares sank sharply for a second day after revelations that it had falsified data about the quality of aluminum and copper products shipped to hundreds of customers.\n",
      "In large part, Japan’s stronger stock market is part of a global rise in optimism. Stock market measures in the United States have also hit new highs in recent weeks, while stocks in South Korea also hit a record on Wednesday. Markets have been lifted by robust global growth and expanding corporate profits, as the world finally appears to be shrugging off years of crises and sluggish growth.\n",
      "But Japan has some of its own good news to share.\n",
      "Japan’s gross domestic product has expanded for six consecutive quarters, the first time it has gone that long without a contraction in 11 years. Unemployment is at multidecade lows, and corporations are experiencing a surge in profits. Even Japan’s longtime economic bugbear — persistent wage and price deflation — has eased, with both consumer prices and incomes showing modest gains.\n",

      "THE News IS: “It’s pretty hard to change the culture of a nation,” Francesco said, “but golf’s getting more popular.”\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "There are more than 90,000 registered golfers in Italy according to the Italian Golf Federation. The Molinari brothers were exposed to the game at a young age, trailing after their grandparents and parents — their father is a dentist, and their mother is a homemaker — on weekend trips to the course in the Alp-fringed city of Turin, host of the 2006 Winter Olympics. (Francesco even carried the Olympic torch for a stretch.)\n",
      "The brothers, born 21 months apart, have been feeding off each other’s games ever since they dominated their local club championships at the Circolo Golf Torino as teenagers.\n",
      "Edoardo won the 2005 U.S. Amateur Championship, the first European to do so since 1911. Francesco picked up his maiden professional victory when he won the Italian Open in 2006, becoming the first native-born champion since 1980.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "“Whenever one succeeds, the other is quick to top him,” said Denis Pugh, who began coaching the brothers in 2002 and has instructed Francesco ever since.\n",
      "“It’s a rivalry in a good sense, in a good way,” Edoardo said.\n",
      "In 2009, the Molinaris teamed up to win the World Cup for Italy — a competition for two-man national teams staged in China — and were partners on Europe’s winning Ryder Cup team a year later. In doing so, they became the first brothers in 47 years to play on the same Ryder Cup team. Since then, their fortunes have diverged.\n",
      "Francesco was the only Molinari on Europe’s victorious Ryder Cup team in 2012, and he has climbed to No. 18 in the Official World Golf Ranking, and No. 7 in the European Tour Race to Dubai heading into the fifth Rolex Series event at the Golf Club Milano starting on Thursday.\n",
      "Edoardo, on the other hand, had two surgeries on his left hand, and he has slipped to No. 308 in the world. But he has regained his health and this season showed signs of rediscovering his game when he won the European Tour’s Trophee Hassan II in Morocco in April.\n",
      "Francesco has not won a tournament since the Italian Open last year, but he finished second at the European Tour’s PGA Championship and threatened to win his first major at the P.G.A. Championship at Quail Hollow Golf Club in Charlotte, N.C., finishing in a three-way tie for second, two strokes behind Justin Thomas.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "“On the 16th tee, I said to myself, ‘You need to make one birdie on the last three holes to have a chance,’ ” Molinari said of the closing stretch, nicknamed The Green Mile. “Those holes are very hard and when I made bogey at 16, it was kind of over for me.”\n",

      "Molinari, who is renowned for his accuracy, drove into the rough at 16. Pugh calls his pupil the best mid-iron player in the world, capable of hitting his 5-iron inside the wedge of the longest hitters. Spain’s Gonzalo Fernandez-Castaño, who has played against Molinari since they were teenagers, marvels at how Molinari rarely misses a fairway or a green.\n",
      "“If you want to calibrate your TrackMan,” Castaño said of the electronic device that gives real-time measurements of golf shots, “take it to Francesco. He’s a machine.”\n",
      "Molinari is also a disciplined student of the game, and he recently added width to his swing and a performance coach to help improve his flexibility. It has paid off this season as Molinari added more than 5 yards in driving distance (to 292.4) while remaining one of the straightest drivers (No. 6 in driving accuracy).\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "He also improved from 70th to 5th in approach shots from 100 to 125 yards this year, and sank more putts, particularly from 7 to 14 feet. In his third year as a PGA Tour member, Molinari improved nearly a full stroke in strokes gained: total, — which measures a player’s performance against the field by comparing a player’s score to the field average — ranking seventh on Tour.\n",
      "All that is missing is that elusive first win on the circuit. Silvia Cavalleri became the first Italian native to win on the LPGA Tour in 2007, but no Italian-born golfer has ever won a PGA Tour event.\n",
      "“That’s pretty much the reason why I decided to start playing more in the U.S.,” Molinari said. “I’ve been getting closer.”\n",
      "Molinari has four titles on the European Tour, including the 2010 WGC HSBC Champions before it was recognized as a PGA Tour victory. What has held him back from taking the top prize more often in the trophy hunt?\n",
      "“The long game can take you only so far,” Molinari said. “You can be in contention and have good finishes more often than other people, but when it comes to crunchtime you have to make the putts at the right time.”\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "“I tell him he hasn’t won as much as he should’ve because he’s trying too hard to win,” Pugh said. “Francesco has to let it happen rather than trying to make it happen.”\n",
      "As long as he keeps making steady progress, Molinari is confident he will win.\n",
      "Pugh predicts that once Molinari wins his first tournament on the PGA Tour, it will not be his last. “He’s capable of a major, maybe two,” Pugh said.\n",
      "For all of Molinari’s success, he remains quiet and levelheaded, with sneaky-good humor. He plays with a cold, calculating style that sometimes gives the impression that he would rather be in his father’s dental chair than drilling golf shots.\n",
      "“I just wish he’d smile more when he played,” Pugh said. “He’s got a good set of teeth. He should show them off a bit more.”\n",

      "Sad, tender and quietly moving, “The Departure” never says more than it needs to, much like its subject, a Buddhist priest who counsels those contemplating suicide.\n",
      "The documentary, directed by Lana Wilson, follows Ittetsu Nemoto, who after a troubled adolescence became a monk, then a priest, in Japan. He settled with his wife, child and mother at a temple in Gifu prefecture where he spends nearly all his time trying to dissuade those in danger of taking their own lives.\n",
      "The men and women here convey deep torment and helplessness. Mr. Nemoto occasionally asks questions, gives advice or offers reasons to live. But more often he listens, and his face registers both empathy for them and sometimes despair at his own shortcomings. “I’m sorry,” he says softly to one troubled woman as he looks away. “I’m not being much help, am I?”\n",
      "Video\n",
      "His nearness to their pain takes a toll. Mr. Nemoto’s health declines as the unceasing calls and emails he receives wear on him. “I take on so much of their suffering when I’m counseling,” he says. “I can never show them how draining is it.”\n",
      "Ms. Wilson resists any urge to overexplain the priest’s work or the people he encounters. Instead, she captures their forlorn expressions and records their searching questions. (Viewers seeking additional background on Mr. Nemoto can find it in an excellent article from The New Yorker by Larissa MacFarquhar, which inspired this film.) Nathan Michel’s score is haunting.\n",
      "Like a haiku, “The Departure” weighs its words carefully. But silences, too, play a vital role here. During its quiet moments, we can only watch this priest comfort the despaired and hope that he succeeds.\n",

      "THE News IS: FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - World Cup 2018 Qualifiers - news conference - Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) headquarters, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, September 15, 2017. Brazilian national team head coach Tite attends a news conference to announce his team's squad which will play against Bolivia and Chile. REUTERS/Sergio Moraes\n",
      "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Little more than a year has gone by since Tite took over as coach of a Brazil side still reeling from embarrassing exits in the World Cup and Copa America but in that short time he has transformed the team into favorites for Russia 2018.\n",
      "No one could have imagined just how influential the former Corinthians coach would be but nine wins in 10 World Cup qualifiers are just reward for a return to the form that won them a record five World Cup titles.\n",
      "“There is no questioning the enormous quality of Brazil’s players, Tite and backroom staff,” the normally cautious former World Cup winner Tostao wrote before the final two qualifiers against Bolivia and Chile. “The team is ready.”\n",
      "Tite retained several players who had misfired under Luiz Felipe Scolari during the 2014 World Cup and his successor Dunga but he transformed their front line with the introduction of attack-minded youngsters Philippe Coutinho and Gabriel Jesus.\n",
      "In midfield he recalled Paulinho and Renato Augusto, his former charges at Corinthians.\n",
      "With Real Madrid’s Casemiro an automatic choice to anchor the team and Neymar still the undisputed talisman, the side is settled and there are no major disagreements over the first 11 for the first time in years.\n",
      "Tite’s task between now and next June is mostly deciding who will support those leading men.\n",
      "The problem, if there is one, comes with Brazil’s almost customary over-confidence. They are the only side to play in every World Cup and even after their 7-1 hammering by Germany in the 2014 semi-finals on home soil, they believe they are special.\n",
      "Just as in 2006, when Brazil sailed through the qualifiers with players like Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Ronaldinho and Adriano, they go to Russia as one of the clear favorites.\n",
      "But Brazil were knocked out at the quarter-final stage by France and over confidence was one of the reasons cited.\n",
      "Tite is a master of playing down expectations and - crucially in a nation that famously has 200 million coaches – he commands the respect of both players and press.\n",
      "That has given him an authority that few Brazil managers this century have enjoyed and he has used it to warn their outstanding form is no guarantee of success.\n",
      "“We are at a stage of strengthening, consolidating and growing,” he said when announcing his squad for this week’s games.\n",
      "“We’re not in the comfort zone stage but rather a confidence zone stage.”\n",

      "THE News IS: Broken2th And Crystal Sun Release “Castaliah”\n",
      "(Before It's News)\n",
      "The electronic indie pop album \"Castaliah,\" a collaboration between Broken2th and Crystal Sun, released digitally on July 17th. Mixed and mastered by Broken2th (Brian Frederick) at Hybrid Studios in Orange County, the record already has over three thousand plays on Spotify in its first two weeks. In addition to Broken2th and Crystal Sun, the album features artists like Donald Clay (The Pharcide) on keys, John Patrick Seedborg (Ronnie King) on trombone, and Vanessa Acosta (Bootleg Orchestra) on trumpet. \"I've been known primarily as an engineer for a long time, and with this project I wanted to step out of that shadow and into the role of composer / producer. Its important for an album to have continuity, to have a producer and an artist locked in sync to create a combined effort, and to create a work of art that represents what both want to say,\" said Frederick, \"This album took a few years to create, and we went through a lot of ups and downs. I think you can really hear that in the music.\" \"Castaliah\" has been in the works since 2012, with songs tracked around the country at various studios and locations along the way and finalized at Hybrid Studios. Crystal Sun and Broken2th are planning to release at least two more songs before the end of 2017 and have many more currently in the writing process. Frederick also plans on releasing a full-length album this year from Subtle Smiles, a collaboration with Marley Rae from Long Beach electronic soul band Bootleg Orchestra. You can hear \"Castaliah\" now on iTunes at https://itun.es/us/w-Kclb. About Hybrid Studios Hybrid Studios is a fully integrated multimedia production facility in Orange County, CA.

      "Eminem, who has never shied away from a feud, has made Mr. Trump a target before. In August, during a performance at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, Eminem told the crowd that he “can’t stand” the president before leading them in an obscene anti-Trump chant. Days earlier, at a concert in Glasgow, the rapper wore a shirt reading “FACK TRUMP” and made similar comments about the president before performing his song “White America.” (“See the problem is/I speak to suburban kids/who otherwise would’ve never knew these words exist.”)\n",
      "But in an earlier era, the two men appeared together amicably. Ahead of the 2004 presidential election, Mr. Trump made a cameo in the Eminem concert special “The Shady National Convention,” which aired on MTV. “I know a winner when I see one,” Mr. Trump said in an endorsement of Eminem’s alter-ego, Slim Shady. “Donald Trump is telling you right now Slim Shady is a winner. He’s got brains, he’s got guts and he’s got Donald Trump’s vote.”\n",
      "The rapper’s dense, blistering lyrics have courted controversy in the past, with some accusing him of writing homophobic and misogynistic verses.\n",
      "And this is not the first time that Eminem has tackled politics in his songs: He has also taken aim at Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and George W. Bush. Last October, he released the freestyle track “Campaign Speech,” in which he called Mr. Trump “a loose cannon who’s blunt with his hand on the button.”\n",
      "Eminem is thought to be gearing up for the release this year of his eighth major-label album and first since “The Marshall Mathers LP 2” in 2013. (A longtime producer for the rapper said earlier this month that the new music was “done.”) In the last few years, he has popped up for occasional guest verses and soundtrack songs — he is featured on Pink’s “Revenge,” out Friday — but has largely remained in the shadows, away from celebrity and social media.\n",
      "“Sometimes I think that if I get comfortable or set in my ways of doing something, maybe I should step back for a minute and figure out how to mix it up a little bit,” he told The New York Times in 2015.\n",
      "Other hip-hop artists and rappers have also targeted the president in their lyrics and music videos. The California rapper YG released a single last August called “FDT,” in which he repeatedly curses Mr. Trump’s name. Kendrick Lamar lashed out at Mr. Trump in his tracks “The Heart Part 4” and “XXX.” Snoop Dogg’s music video “Lavender,” in which the rapper aimed a toy pistol at a clown resembling Mr. Trump, earned a rebuke and a call for “jail time!” from the president himself in March.\n",

      "THE News IS: The logo of Mexico's state-owned company Pemex is pictured at a refinery in Cadereyta, on the outskirts of Monterrey, Mexico, April 20, 2017. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril\n",
      "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Two foreign oil companies on Wednesday won the rights to partner with Mexico’s oil company Pemex on two onshore blocks, a first since landmark energy reform, while a third offshore area received no bids.\n",
      "The auction was run by the National Hydrocarbons Commission, the industry regulator, and marks only the second time partnership rights for Pemex projects have been made available.\n",
      "Egypt’s Cheiron Holdings Limited and Germany’s DEA Deutsche Erdoel won the rights to partner with Petróleos Mexicanos, commonly known as Pemex, on its Cardenas-Mora and Ogarrio blocks, respectively, which officials touted as a way to quickly boost production via new investment.\n",
      "“This underscores the beauty of the energy reform,” said Pemex Chief Executive Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya shortly after the auction.\n",
      "“Before, we would have to invest everything and now we only have to pay half and we receive a payment to be able to meet those costs,” he said.\n",
      "Mexico’s 2013 constitutional reform ended Pemex’s decades-long production monopoly. It also allowed the company to enter into joint ventures with equity partners for the first time in a bid to help reverse more than a dozen years of declining output.\n",
      "The onshore Cardenas-Mora area, a 65-square-mile (168 sq km) block in southern Tabasco state is believed to contain some 93 million barrels of mostly light crude. Pemex will receive a $125 million payment from Cheiron reflecting the company’s past investments in the area, Pemex said in a statement.\n",
      "Cheiron also agreed to pay Pemex another $41 million on top of the 13 percent additional royalty it bid for the partnerships rights, Pemex said.\n",
      "The Cardenas-Mora project is seen requiring a total of $1.1 billion to successfully develop over the life of the contract, while the Ogarrio project is seen requiring some $490 million, according to Pemex estimates.\n",
      "“We’re extremely happy, and we’re looking forward to this opportunity,” said Shady Kabel, Cheiron’s country manager for Mexico.\n",
      "In the case of the Ogarrio area, a 60-square mile (156 sq km) field also in Tabasco estimated to contain 54 million barrels in mostly light crude, Pemex will receive $190 million from DEA Deutsche, Pemex said in a statement.\n",
      "The German company also offered to pay a record-setting $213.9 million for the partnership rights on top of the 13 percent additional royalty, a sum that will be divided between Pemex and the government’s petroleum fund, said Martin Alvarez, an official at the National Hydrocarbons Commission.\n",
      "A third joint venture for the shallow water Ayin-Batsil block received no bids, which Gonzalez Anaya attributed to the complexity of the project.\n",
      "He also said Pemex would review the $250 million that Pemex calculated as its past investment in the area, a figure a potential partner would have had to reimburse and might have curtailed interest in the project.\n",
      "Both Cheiron and DEA Deutsche will operate the projects under license contracts with a 50 percent stake while Pemex will retain the remaining half.\n",
      "Pemex’s chief executive said he expected Ogarrio’s oil output to reach as much as 14,000 barrels per day (bpd) from about 10,000 bpd currently over the next year, while Cardenas-Mora’s production should increase to 14,000 bpd by 2020 from about 10,000 bpd.\n",
      "Late last year, Pemex’s first joint venture partnership was won by Australia’s BHP Billiton, which took a 60 percent operating interest in the deepwater Trion project, a development seen requiring some $11 billion over the life of the contract.\n",

      "THE News IS: Hurun valued the wealth of Mr. Xu, chairman and founder of China Evergrande, at $43 billion, largely because of his firm’s Hong Kong-listed shares, which have soared five times in the past year. The surge has come despite worries about Evergrande’s debt load, which grew sharply last year as the company expanded. Evergrande did not respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "Mr. Xu replaced Wang Jianlin, a property and entertainment power broker, as China’s richest person. Mr. Wang had become the poster boy for China’s Hollywood ambitions after his acquisition of the AMC theater chain and Legendary Entertainment.\n",
      "More recently, Mr. Wang’s fortunes have symbolized China’s new skepticism over its global makers. In June, a senior banking regulator warned that some of the country’s biggest companies could pose a systemic risk to state banks, reflecting Beijing’s anxiety that mounting debt levels could destabilize the Chinese economy.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "That month, Mr. Wang divested much of its theme park and hotel holdings. He also delisted one of his companies from Hong Kong, where shares have risen 19 percent in the past year. “Had he not delisted from Hong Kong, he wouldn’t be in the position that he would be now,” Mr. Hoogewerf said.\n",
      "Hurun said he and his family’s net worth fell 28 percent to $23 billion in the last year. Wanda declined to comment.\n",
      "Wanda is considered one of China’s gray rhinos, so named because they represent large but ignored potential threats to the country’s economy. Among the leaders of the other gray rhinos, Guo Guangchang, the chairman of the financial conglomerate Fosun, saw his wealth rise 40 percent to $9.3 billion, according to Hurun. Chen Feng, the co-founder and co-chairman of HNA Group, was a new addition to the survey, with a net worth of about $2.3 billion.\n",

      "China’s tech tycoons — Pony Ma of Tencent and Jack Ma of Alibaba — were the second- and third-richest in the survey. Hurun valued Pony Ma’s fortune at $37 billion. As No. 2 on the Chinese wealth list, he succeeds Jack Ma, whose net worth fell 2 percent to $30 billion because he sold down his stake in his firm’s financial affiliate, Ant Financial.\n",
      "The survey reflects a surge of money going into companies like Tencent and Ant Financial — the internet giants that run WeChat and Alipay — as investors bet on more users going cashless.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "Alibaba and Ant Financial have 43 shareholders who made the list. Alibaba’s market cap is now $473 billion, while Tencent’s is at $428 billion. In contrast, Exxon Mobil is valued around $350 billion.\n",
      "Some names on the rich list belong to some of China’s most powerful bodies. Three of the entrepreneurs on the list — Li Denghai, a corn tycoon; Wu Shaoxun, an alcohol magnate; and Pan Gang, who made his fortune in milk — will be delegates to the 19th Communist Party Congress, a once-in-five-years political meeting that will convene later this month to pick a new slate of Chinese leaders.\n",
      "In March, Hurun said the combined fortune of the wealthiest members of the country’s Parliament and its advisory body amounts to $500 billion, just below the annual economic output of Sweden.\n",
      "New additions to the list’s top 10 include Yang Huiyan of the property developer Country Garden, Wang Wei of the delivery company SF Express and Li Shufu of the carmaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.\n",
      "Many of the entrepreneurs featured in the survey have rags-to-riches backgrounds that epitomize the sharp ascent of the world’s second-largest economy in the span of a decade. According to Hurun, China now accounts for 36 percent of the world’s billionaires. It has 647 billionaires in American dollar terms, up from 594 the year before. In 2003, there were none.\n",

      "THE News IS: (Reuters) - You have seen his “Sunflowers” in a museum, sung along with Don McLean to “Vincent (Starry Starry Night)” and gawped at the tens of million of dollars his works have fetched at auction.\n",
      "But you have never seen Vincent Van Gogh’s art quite like it is shown in the film “Loving Vincent.”\n",
      "Seven years in the making and billed as the world’s first fully-painted feature film, “Loving Vincent” uses more than 130 of the Dutch artist’s own paintings to tell his own story.\n",
      "Each of the 65,000 frames of the animated independent film, created by Polish artist and animator Dorota Kobiela, is an oil painting hand painted by 125 professional artists who traveled from around the world to be a part of the project.\n",
      "“It looks like something completely different, and that doesn’t happen very often in our media-saturated world,” said Hugh Welchman, who co-wrote and directed the film with Kobiela.\n",
      "“Loving Vincent,” showing in limited release in New York and Los Angeles and arriving in Europe in October, was first filmed with actors playing some of the people Van Gogh captured on canvas.\n",
      "They include Saiorse Ronan as doctor’s daughter Marguerite Gachet and Chris O‘Dowd as postman Joseph Roulin, who walk through and inhabit his paintings as his story unfolds.\n",
      "Then came the hard part. Finding and training the painters to reproduce Van Gogh’s work.\n",
      "FILE PHOTO: Visitors take pictures with their mobile phone of the painting \"Portrait de l'Artiste, 1889\" (Self-Portrait) by artist Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, France, July 28, 2015. REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\n",
      "More than 4,000 artists from around the world applied for the job and 125 were chosen and put through three weeks training.\n",
      "“Even though we were hiring the very best oil painters, Vincent’s style look like it should be very easy but actually it’s difficult to do well,” said Welchman.\n",
      "“Even after training there were still quite a few painters who really found it impossible to get to grips with his style,” Welchman said.\n",
      "The $5.5 million production focuses on the last weeks of Van Gogh’s life before his death in 1890 in France at age 37 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n",
      "Welchman said the film has triggered some unusual responses.\n",
      "“We’ve had a lot of people in tears at screenings. People are sending poems or making cakes with intricate Vincent paintings on the cake,” he said.\n",
      "He and Kobiela hope the film encourages audiences to discover more about Van Gogh.\n",
      "“I’d like them to think there is more to his story than he went mad, cut off his ears, was a genius and did these incredibly colorful paintings that sell for lots of money.”\n",

      "‘Liddle’ Bob Corker\n",
      "President Trump’s feud with Senator Bob Corker continued on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump tweeted to suggest that Mr. Corker, a Republican, had been tricked by The New York Times into saying disparaging things about the president. On “The Late Late Show,” James Corden took aim at Mr. Trump from a variety of angles.\n",
      "“So that’s where we’re at: Donny made fun of Little Bobby for being short. And if you’ve just tuned in, I’m not reporting things my 6-year-old saw on the playground today. I’m sharing news from the White House.” — JAMES CORDEN “In that tweet, Trump insinuates that The New York Times set up Bob Corker by recording him, but the transcript actually shows that they had Corker’s full consent. And when Trump heard that, he said, ‘Wait — what’s consent?’” — JAMES CORDEN\n",
      "Mr. Corden also addressed another internecine fight that’s occupying Mr. Trump’s time.\n",
      "“In an interview today, Trump addressed the rumors that his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, called him a moron, by saying, quote, ‘If he did that, I guess we’ll have to compare I.Q. tests, and I can tell you who is going to win.’ Yeah, I can also tell you who’s going to win: It’s not the guy who spells ‘little’ like this.” — JAMES CORDEN\n",
      "Sidestepping the Weinstein Story\n",
      "The New Yorker on Tuesday published an unsparing investigation into the film producer Harvey Weinstein’s conduct with female actors and models, including accusations that he raped multiple women. But the late-night shows seemed reluctant to deal with the reports, and only some addressed them at all. Even those shows that did failed to spend much time on the revelations or mention the most unsettling accusations.\n",
      "“The New Yorker today released audio of fired Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein begging a model to come into his room and watch him shower. And by the looks of him, I’m guessing that shower never happened.” — SETH MEYERS “Another big story is this Harvey Weinstein scandal. Today some very serious allegations came out about his sexual misconduct. You can tell they’re bad because Anthony Weiner just unfriended him.” — JIMMY FALLON\n",
      "Facebook News\n",
      "Stephen Colbert discussed Elon Musk’s suggestions that artificial intelligence could pose a greater threat to humanity than North Korea’s nuclear program. Mark Zuckerberg had called that claim “pretty irresponsible,” leading Mr. Musk to tweet a spicy, dismissive response.\n",
      "“Hey Elon, it’s not Mark Zuckerberg’s fault that he’s misinformed. He gets his news from Facebook.” — STEPHEN COLBERT\n",
      "The Punchiest Punchlines (Stephen Miller Edition)\n",
      "“According to reports, White House aide Stephen Miller tried to run in a girls’ track event while he was in high school, in order to prove men are better athletes than women — totally forgetting that seeing Stephen Miller just makes women run faster.” — SETH MEYERS\n",
      "“President Trump is back to golfing, and he played with Lindsey Graham yesterday and said that it was ‘wet and windy.’ Luckily some people from Puerto Rico came and threw their paper towels at him.” — JIMMY FALLON\n",

      "THE News IS: With four more victories, the Yankees will advance to the World Series for the first time since winning it eight years ago.\n",
      "“The ’09 team, we were very confident in spring training; we felt like we knew we were going to win,” reliever David Robertson said. “This team, there’s a lot of guys that are realizing that they can win, that they’re that good.”\n",
      "Robertson joined the Yankees in June 2008, one day before Gardner, who has an unbroken decade of service. Those two, and starter C. C. Sabathia, are the only Yankees who also played for the 2009 champions. All figured prominently in Wednesday’s 5-2 clincher, Sabathia and Robertson working the first seven innings, and Gardner breaking the Indians’ will in the ninth.\n",
      "He came to bat with two on and two outs, the Yankees ahead by a run, and had to face Cody Allen, the Indians’ star closer. Gardner had already done plenty in Game 5, including a single ahead of Didi Gregorius’s second home run. But he was ready to duel Allen, to knife the heart from the defending A.L. champs.\n",
      "The batter behind Gardner, Aaron Judge, had looked as anemic in the first eight innings as he did in his brief trial late last season, with four strikeouts. But Gardner was convinced that Judge’s presence meant he would keep seeing fastballs, and he knew that if he survived long enough, he could hit one.\n",
      "“It’s an eternity,” said Gardner, who complimented Allen’s stuff. “I fouled off a really good breaking ball, maybe the seventh or eighth pitch, and after that I figured he would stay with the fastball because I’ve got the big guy on deck behind me.”\n",
      "On the 12th pitch, Gardner lashed a single to right. No team had ever struck out as many times as the Yankees did on Wednesday (16) and still won a nine-inning postseason game. But Gardner showed the value of putting the ball in play: Not only did Aaron Hicks score, but so did Todd Frazier, on an errant throw.\n",

      "This time, facing elimination in Cleveland, Aroldis Chapman held the three-run lead. He blew that advantage in Game 7 of the World Series for the Chicago Cubs last November, but recovered to earn the victory in his last game for them.\n",
      "Chapman soon became the Yankees’ winter extravagance, signing the richest deal ever for a closer (five years, $86 million) to return to the club that had traded him to Chicago. He has been overwhelming this postseason, with 13 strikeouts in six and two-thirds scoreless innings. He recognizes some traits in the Yankees that he saw in the Cubs last fall.\n",
      "“There’s a couple of things that are similar; there are a lot of young players here, and people get along very well here in this clubhouse,” Chapman said through an interpreter, as catcher Gary Sanchez sprayed him with Champagne.\n",
      "Photo\n",
      "“And the same as last year with the Cubs, it was a fun clubhouse to be a part of. What I see here is everybody gets along, and everybody understands what kind of job they need to do.”\n",
      "These days it is Robertson’s job to work multiple innings in middle relief, and he has thrived. When Dellin Betances struggled in Game 4, it was Tommy Kahnle’s job to earn his first save of the season — and he did.\n",
      "Robertson and Kahnle arrived with Frazier from the Chicago White Sox in a trade for prospects in July. So did starter Sonny Gray, from the Oakland Athletics. All but Frazier are under team control for next year. General Manager Brian Cashman, who had aggressively built prospect inventory, was thrilled to give some away.\n",

      "“You’re always hoping you’re in a position to do that,” Cashman said. “You want your team to force you to do something.”\n",
      "When he did, a championship — not just a fun little season of progress — suddenly seemed realistic. Designated hitter Matt Holliday, a veteran of three World Series, understood the impact of those moves.\n",
      "“When you add Kahnle and David Robertson to a bullpen that’s already very strong,” Holliday said, “that was when I thought, ‘We have a real chance to win the World Series.’ ”\n",

      "After the Minnesota Twins chased Luis Severino after one out of the wild-card game, Chad Green led a ruthless display of bullpen force. The Yankees expected much better of Severino in that game — he was an All-Star after going 0-8 as a starter last season – but the relievers overcame his failure. Then he dominated Cleveland six days later.\n",
      "For the Indians on Wednesday, it was a swift and brutal ending, an unlucky 13th trip to the postseason for a team that has not won a title since 1948. What if Judge were not 6 feet 7 inches, and had not caught Francisco Lindor’s would-be homer in a 1-0 Game 3 loss? What if Corey Kluber had not worn down (“He’s fighting a lot,” Manager Terry Francona conceded) and twice pitched so poorly?\n",
      "“I thought that they had an edge that couldn’t be defeated,” the Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, a Yankees special adviser, said of the Indians. “I really thought they would be so hard to beat, and I never thought this guy would pitch two bad games. I never thought he’d pitch twice like he did.”\n",
      "Yet Jackson knows how quickly scripts can flip in October. In the 1972 A.L.C.S., with Oakland, Jackson tore his hamstring to end his season. An unheralded teammate, Gene Tenace, played his role to perfection in the World Series, slamming four home runs to lead the A’s to the first of three consecutive titles.\n",
      "A generation later, the Yankees matched that feat with a homegrown core of Bernie Williams, Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte and Jorge Posada. In 1995, those players were all in Seattle for a decisive fifth game of another division series. The Yankees lost, but they built off that defeat to start a dynasty.\n",
      "The new homegrown stars – Judge, Sanchez, Severino, Greg Bird – faced the same outcome on Wednesday. Had it happened, no rational fan could have switched off the TV and called the season a failure. Just making it this far would have been an achievement.\n",
      "But the Yankees won, and it feels like the start of something.\n",
      "“We hope so, but sports can change things,” Cashman said. “Injuries, there’s a lot of things. That’s why you’ve got to grasp the moment when it comes around.”\n",
      "He mentioned the battered Mets and his favorite N.F.L. franchise, the winless Giants. Neither team expected to flop.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "“There’s no guarantee,” Cashman said. “I mean, we do believe we’re building on something. But we’re not going to sit here and assume that the next three to five years are going to be perfect. We’ve got to reinforce it every which way we can, because storm clouds are always brewing. That’s the problem with sports — you can never guarantee anything.”\n",
      "The problem with sports is also the beauty of it. This was not supposed to be the Yankees’ year, yet here they are, all grown up in a hurry. They might as well keep winning.\n",
      "“That’s what I’ve told these guys: ‘This is what it’s all about, this is the reason we play,’ ” Gardner said. “We’re not ready to go home yet.”\n",

      "The Golden Knights’ home opener was a bit more somber than the franchise originally planned, although the crowd was still whipped into a frenzy by the team’s excellent play. T-Mobile Arena had no ads on the boards around the ice for the opener. Instead, the all-white boards simply displayed the same message: “Vegas Strong.”\n",

      "THE News IS: Photo\n",
      "A biopic can take any life, no matter how transgressive or interesting, and reduce it to check marks on a list. In “Tom of Finland,” a primarily Finnish-language feature from Dome Karukoski, the biography is that of Touko Laaksonen (Pekka Strang), the Finnish advertising designer who, under the name Tom of Finland, published drawings of hyper-muscular, well-endowed men and became famous for expanding perceptions on the portrayal of gay life in art.\n",
      "While Mr. Laaksonen devoted his life (1920-91) to challenging conventions, the film is committed to honoring them. The movie traces Mr. Laaksonen’s service in World War II, his experience with public-park cruising and discrimination, and his early illustrations of aggrandized masculinity. (He says the pictures would be easier to publish in the Vatican than in Finland, where homosexuality was outlawed at the time.) His sister (Jessica Grabowsky), a fellow artist, suspicious of his sexuality, dares him to kiss a woman in a game of truth-or-dare.\n",
      "Video\n",
      "Tom’s eureka moment comes when he visits California. Police officers raid a party, appearing as if they’re about to arrest the gay revelers. False alarm: “We’re looking for a suspect who just robbed a mini mart down on Sunset,” one officer says.\n",
      "If the film emphasizes the power that Mr. Laaksonen’s drawings held for the gay community, it’s less interested in his reception as a boundary-breaking artist, a kindred spirit to the filmmaker Kenneth Anger, among others. For those seeking more information, the closing credits actually direct viewers to a website.\n",

      "THE News IS: Sir Alex Ferguson supported Non-League Day 2017 by turning up to watch Macclesfield Town\n",
      "Non-League Day. With the arrival of the international break, it is the date in the diary every year when fans are encouraged to support their smaller local sides.\n",
      "While the Premier League usually takes all the headlines, there are plenty of great stories from the lower leagues as grassroots football is celebrated across the country.\n",
      "With protesting fans returning home, cute dogs and one of English football's most decorated managers all giving their support, BBC Sport casts its eye across five things you may have missed from Non-League Day 2017.\n",
      "Kettering back on the rise?\n",
      "Media playback is not supported on this device Rockingham Road\n",
      "Kettering Town have had something of an illustrious history, as the first club in both Ron Atkinson's storied managerial career and Paul Gascoigne's not-so-storied time in the dugout (Gazza lasted 39 days and never managed again).\n",
      "But despite promotion to the Conference Premier and two trips to the fourth round of the FA Cup - almost forcing Premier League Fulham to a replay in 2009 - times have been hard of late for their fans.\n",
      "They lost their Rockingham Road ground in 2011, went into administration shortly afterwards and were then demoted to the Southern Premier League.\n",
      "Further relegations have followed - but now they are back on the up.\n",
      "Their emphatic 5-0 over Merthyr Town at their current home of Latimer Park - which they share with United Counties League side Burton Park Wanderers - kept them top of the Southern Premier League, three levels below the English Football League.\n",
      "With nine victories from 10 games so far, perhaps the glory days could be coming back to this part of Northamptonshire?\n",
      "Ultras return to protest\n",
      "Clapton's Ultras have boycotted the club's home games this season\n",
      "Clapton FC have called the Old Spotted Dog Ground their home since 1888. It is the oldest senior football ground in London, no less.\n",
      "But this season their most dedicated of fans have refused to go to home games in protest at plans to liquidate the charitable company that holds the lease for the stadium.\n",
      "Fans group Real Clapton FC have also raised funds to try to stop the liquidation process and secure the Essex Senior League club's home.\n",
      "But on Saturday Clapton were 'away' to the club they share their ground with, Hackney Wick, so the Ultras returned.\n",
      "Their presence seemed to galvanise their idols, as Clapton won 2-1 to move up to 10th place in the table.\n",
      "Sir Alex casts his eye on the National League\n",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson (left) never took a Manchester United side to the Moss Rose\n",
      "They are top of the National League and on Saturday Macclesfield Town welcomed one of football's greatest-ever managers to the Moss Rose.\n",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson was there to run his expert eye over the Silkmen as they hosted Ebbsfleet United in the highest tier of non-league football.\n",
      "Follow Match of the Day on Instagram for the best photos from the world of football.\n",
      "Macclesfield did not disappoint their illustrious onlooker as Mitch Hancox's goal just before half-time sealed a 1-0 victory. It was Town's fourth successive win and eighth victory in their past 10 games.\n",
      "If Jose Mourinho starts to struggle at Old Trafford, perhaps Sir Alex will give Macclesfield boss John Askey a call?\n",
      "The road to Wembley starts here\n",
      "Moneyfields play their home games just a mile and a half away from League One side Portsmouth\n",
      "It was FA Trophy preliminary round day on Saturday - 128 clubs vying for the right to make it into the first qualifying round later this month.\n",
      "While some sides have been there many times before, for others, like Southern League Division One East club Moneyfields, it was their first-ever game in the Football Association's second-tier knockout tournament.\n",
      "Portsmouth-based Moneyfields have made it to the eighth tier of the English football pyramid for the first time and taken to it like ducks to water.\n",
      "The club is unbeaten in the league this season, have won all four of their home games and top their division.\n",
      "So their opponents Bideford, who play in the Southern League's Division One West, were always going to face an uphill battle and even more so when you consider it is a 350-mile round trip from North Devon to West Hampshire.\n",
      "The Devon side have a great away record in their league - having won both of their trips away from The Sports Ground - but they were no match for their hosts, who raced into a 4-1 half-time lead before Bideford got a second-half consolation goal to end the tie 4-2.\n",
      "Moneyfields travel to either Fleet Town or Yate Town in the next round, after the pair drew 1-1.\n",

      "Never mind the football, the stars of Non-League Day have arguably been the furry friends that accompany their owners on the sidelines.\n",
      "And, while Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp may well have his feet up during this international break, Jurgen the Yorkshire Terrier was taking in a game.\n",
      "Klopp's four-legged namesake was on a scouting mission in the second round of the Somerset Senior Cup as Stockwood Green took on Peasedown Miners Welfare.\n",
      "And he was treated to a thriller - Stockwood Green winning 5-3 in extra time after the sides were deadlocked at 3-3 after 90 minutes.\n",

      "THE News IS: Obayashi, a company from Japan, has revealed that they want to build an elevator up into space by the year 2050.\n",
      " \n",
      "Space Elevator Would Go 96,000km Into Space\n",
      " \n",
      "The space elevator was said to go up around 96,000 km into space and it would be able to take people and shipments to a new space station. The company also plan on using the space elevator to transport astronauts to Mars and even beyond. The process of construction is to consist of the deployment of a cable and then the construction of facilities. The cable dynamics would need to be analyzed so that estimation could be gathered of the characteristics of the cable, the facilities, counter-weight and the climbers so that the construction procedures could be determined.\n",
      " \n",
      "The parameters for the dynamics of the cable are said to include displacement, tension and the elongation of the cable for ascending climbers, the wind, fixed loads of the facilities, the counter-weight and the cable. The company said that the system has been designed using a computer simulation of the equations of motion, which allowed them to determine the construction process.\n",

      "The video showed a cable going up into space from the ocean, with facilities and even people floating around in the facilities, peering out of windows looking down at what is presumably Earth. Obayashi said that the space elevators could help to reduce the cost of payloads being sent into space by as much as 90%. They pointed out that the elevator to space would do away with the need to build and use rockets. The company also plan on using the system as a port to allow space travel by astronauts over long distances.\n",

      "Carbon Nanotube Cable Or Diamond Nanothreads Used In Construction\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "The space elevator would consist of a carbon nanotube cable of some 96,000km, carbon nanotubes are said to be lighter and stronger than the majority of materials known. An alternative would be to construct the cable from diamond nanothreads. It was said that one of the ends of the cable would be attached to the surface of Earth, probably on the ocean, and the other end would extend around 36,000km in space. The cable would also be attached to a counterweight weighing 13,000 tons to help with the stabilization of the elevator. The space elevator would then be able to carry up to 100 tons of people and cargo into deep space.\n",

      "A rapper who goes by the name of BoB follows the theory that the earth is flat, well not actually flat, as he thinks that it is shaped like a disc. He is now trying to generate funds so that he can send satellites up into the orbit of Earth and he is doing this through the GoFundMe site.\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "BoB is from Georgia in the US, and he said that he was starting the fundraising so that he can send out many satellites into space as far as he can to find the curve of the earth. The rapper was born Bobby Ray Simmons, and in four days he has managed to raise $1,700, but out of this sum, $1,000 came out of his own pocket. He is also a member of the Flat Earth Society, which is a forum for freethinkers to talk about alternative science along with the unusual ways of viewing the world.\n",
      " \n",
      "One of the users of the forum, Ben Kelly, donated a sum of $5 and he encouraged people to prove that the government has been lying and that it was time in an era of artificial intelligence that has been manufactured for it to end and new enlightenment to start.\n",

      " \n",
      "Bjorn Pius is also a member of the society, and he managed to donate $10. However, he did so for other reasons. He said that he was donating to the project so that he would have the satisfaction of the rapper and the group humiliate themselves.\n",
      " \n",
      "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist from the US, and he wants to debunk the theory of a flat earth. It was said that he put a challenge up to the rapper through Twitter last year. On Twitter BoB had posted a photograph of him against a skyline and then asked his followers why he was not able to see a curve of the Earth in the photograph. He pointed out that the cities in the photograph background were 16 miles and then he asked where the curve was.\n",
      " \n",
      "Tyson was quick off the mark to give the rapper a lesson in physics. He said that the curve of the Earth blocks 150 foot of Manhattan, but the majority of the buildings in Midtown Manhattan were a lot taller.\n",
      " \n",
      "BoB is just one of the latest celebrities in the US that have joined the group of people who believe that the earth is not round. Kyrie Irving and Shaquille O`Neal also left themselves open to ridicule last year when they both insisted that the Earth was flat.\n",

       "\"FILE PHOTO: An employee is seen behind a glass wall with the logo of Alibaba at the company's headquarters on the outskirts of Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, April 23, 2014. REUTERS/Chance Chan/File Photo\\nLONDON (Reuters) - The boom in emerging market technology stocks is becoming a problem for fund managers of all stripes.\\nThe soaring market capitalization of a handful of companies such as China’s Alibaba (BABA.N) and Tencent (0700.HK) is steadily lifting their weighting in the MSCI emerging equities index .MSCIEF.\\nThis means investors in funds that track indexes (exchange traded funds or ETFs) - who want exposure to a range of companies for a lower fund management fee - are finding themselves increasingly exposed to a single sector.\\nMeanwhile, active fund managers, who justify charging higher fees for their individual stock-picking expertise, are under pressure to buy those tech stocks to ensure their funds keep up with the index’s gains.\\nAnd with both sets of investor chasing the same thing, the risk of dramatic outflows increases if the sector falters.\\n“It’s the opposite of what you are trying to do with an ETF - you want cheap diversified exposure but you end up being concentrated in basically 10 stocks,” said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma, who holds active EM funds.\\nThe biggest five emerging market companies in the index are tech firms Alibaba, Tencent, Samsung (005930.KS), Naspers (NPNJn.J) and Taiwan Semiconductor (5425.TWO).\\nThey comprise almost 19 percent of the index's market capitalization. That is a bigger chunk than the S&P 500 where the top five firms - Alphabet (GOOGL.O) , Apple (AAPL.OQ), Facebook (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.OQ), and Amazon (AMZN.OQ) - make up 13 percent .SPX.\\nThe increasing use of ETFs has helped boost valuations further because they must follow the index weighting.\\nAnd the index’s concentration has intensified as valuations rose - the five companies’ share was 13.9 percent in January.\\nDISCOMFORT\\nThe shift toward passive investing, evident across most asset classes, has come into focus in emerging equities, which have enjoyed a sparkling 60 percent rally since early-2016. But the sector may also illustrate the concentration risks that exchange-traded funds can bring to portfolios.\\nEmerging equity funds have received some $56 billion so far this year, Lipper data shows. Of this, $23 billion went into ETFs.\\nInvestors are keen on tech companies which are making profits by disrupting the status quo in sectors from media and advertising to retail and industrials.\\nBut the dependence on technology for returns is causing some discomfort among investors who prefer shares in emerging market car or beverage makers for instance for exposure to consumer demand in the developing world.\\nEd Kerschner, chief portfolio strategist at Columbia Threadneedle, says the tech companies’ performance mostly reflects that of their U.S. peers rather than providing exposure to developing countries.\\n“The question is are you buying emerging markets or are you buying technology?” Kerschner said. “The risk of buying EM benchmarks is that you are not diversifying away from the S&P.”\\nAs a result of the tech rally, the conventional market-cap weighted emerging equity index, with bigger weightings in companies with the largest market caps, has begun strongly outperforming the index where all companies are assigned the same weighting.\\nThe success can also be reversed. Any faltering by the tech leaders would have a proportionally weighty effect on ETFs, potentially spurring big outflows.\\nScott Snyder, co-portfolio manager of the ICON emerging markets fund, estimates that the four biggest tech firms have accounted for a third of 2017’s emerging equity returns.\\n“A lot of people that might just be piling into passive strategies in EM could be overly exposed to technology right now,” ICON’s Snyder said.\\nTHE “WRONG” REASON\\nThere are also signs that many active emerging market managers, who would have had more diverse investments than ETF funds, are sticking more closely to the benchmark.\\nData from Copley Fund Research shows the average active share of global emerging market funds - the extent to which their holdings differ from the index - has fallen to 74.7 percent from a peak of 78 percent in April 2016.\\nPartly this is due to the addition in May 2016 of U.S.-listed Chinese firms to the emerging benchmark - because active investors held these stocks before their inclusion in the index - but competition from ETFs may also play a role.\\n“The effect of rising ETF flows and narrowing breadth has been to push active investors to get closer to their benchmarks,” said Edward Cole, a portfolio manager at GLG Man Group.\\nEven among active managers, many may be holding tech stocks for the “wrong” reason - fear of underperforming the index, said Kiran Nandra-Koehrer, senior product specialist in Pictet Asset Management’s emerging equities team.\\nWhile many investors are wary of paying higher fees for funds to replicate the index, active managers don’t want to risk missing out on meaty returns from tech.\\nA streak of losses and fund closures remains fresh in their mind, with 746 emerging market funds liquidated in the last five years, according to Lipper data.\\nBut Psigma’s McPherson cited one of his holdings, Mirabaud’s Emerging Markets fund, which has returned over 33 percent this year, outgunning the MSCI index’s 29 percent. That shows an active manager can overcome concentration risks.\\n“We would rather our active managers weight to the small tech companies that are better value,” McPherson said.\""
